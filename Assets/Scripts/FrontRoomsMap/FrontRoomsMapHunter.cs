/// The Relay on the generated map. It keeps the Listen → Hunt → Search →
/// Chase → BreakDoor states of the stream hunter, re-expressed for an open
/// grid, and adds Wander:
/// - it is released after a short grace period, in a built cell 9–15 cells of
///   walking away that the player cannot see, preferably behind them;
/// - it does not know where the player is: between noises it wanders to
///   random reachable places (Listen → Wander), keeping to shut doors;
/// - it chases only once it sees the player (a ray at eye height). A noise it
///   hears it walks to and searches (Hunt), without running;
/// - losing sight in a chase, it goes where it last saw the player; if it saw
///   them go through a door in its last second of sight, it follows into the
///   room behind that door. Either way it then searches that room (a few spots,
///   listening at each) and gives up, unless it hears or sees them again;
/// - it paths through built cells with a breadth-first search, breaks shut
///   doors on a hunt or a chase, and cannot pass unbroken glass. A wander or
///   a search never breaks a door: one shut across its way it walks round,
///   and with no way round that leg is over;
/// - if the chase leaves it too far behind, it relays itself closer, unseen;
/// - it has a body (<see cref="ModuleUnits.RelayRadius"/>): it walks straight
///   while the way is clear and plans a detour on a 0.25 m grid around the
///   cell it is in and the next one when furniture, a column or an open door
///   leaf is in the way. With no way round furniture it passes through it,
///   still on a route that keeps out of walls.
/// Positions are world space; the caller drives the rig.
