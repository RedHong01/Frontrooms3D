# Afterglow Blazes: level design proposal for the phosphorescent wallpaper print

**Revision 2 (2026-10-03).** The map chat checked 89 claims in §2, §4 and §11 against the code after its P4 changes: 4 wrong, 37 partly right, 30 outdated, 18 correct. This revision fixes all 71 that were not correct:
- Every file:line now points at the post-P4 code. Anything that is not in the code is marked **Proposed:**.
- The four wrong claims: `ZoneEntered` is a new event, not an existing one (§4). The first-dark cell is picked by path distance, because the code guarantees no straight walk-in line (§4). BREACH and the ink shader path are proposals, not code (§4, §11.1 Step 5).
- HUD: the Relay state and distance are now hidden by default behind one assist toggle. Red decided this and the map chat has landed it (R14, §9, §15 Q1). Whether CHASE and BREAKING DOOR should always show was left open here; Rev 3 closes it (they stay hidden).
- Tiers: T0–T4+ in this doc mean **run tiers** 1–5 (`FrontRooms3DGame.TierChanged`), not the per-chunk generation tier. §6 sets out the convention, and each rule says which tier it reads.
- Lamps: the old LampDip/KillLamp/PromoteLamp list is replaced by the shared lamp-override layer. Its interface was still being agreed at Rev 2; Rev 3 records v1 as agreed (§11.1 Step 1, §11.2).
- Ink substance: it no longer lives in print B. It comes from `_FR_InkType` and `_FR_InkSubstance` (spec v1 at Rev 2, v1.2 at Rev 3; the visual chat's Q2), and it follows the run tier, not print slices (R11, §8, §9, §11.1 Steps 4–5, §12).
- BREACH: doors become single-acting next, and the map chat is adding a break-direction event beside `DoorBroken` (§4).
- Changed SP values, each marked inline: the R6 arch bonus, the power-sag spacing and the border-dusk odds. Corrected derived figures: the chase-wave lead and the Dim-cell G (§4), and when the late lies arrive (§5). Also new: §15 Q13 (visibility).

**Revision 4 (2026-10-03).** This revision follows Relay pursuit v2 (Documentation/RELAY_PURSUIT_REDESIGN.md §9.2, §13 step 11):
- the stage-0 lamp invariant;
- the explicit Warn burst, and the burst gate retuned to it;
- the wake reprint removed;
- the chase wave centred on the player's room set;
- the Relay can open doors (Ajar).

**Pending redirect (not yet confirmed by Red):** Red asked for the hint to be carried by the wallpaper's OWN pattern elements turning or deforming (Figma 2502:4565), not by overlay glyphs. The narrative chat is writing that analysis. The overlay-glyph rendering here (InkShape, _FR_InkType) is on hold. The timing and commit rules are expected to carry over.

**Revision 3 (2026-10-03).** This revision fixes what the Rev 2 verifier found and folds in Red's and the other chats' decisions. After Rev 3's own verifier pass (160 cites checked, all decisions confirmed), seven remaining findings were fixed by hand: three stale cites (:1126, :117, the narrative doc's §5), the burst-gate rationale (dip hold decides, so the plain gate is erratic rather than never open), the promoted-lamp timer example, the systems-chat §7.5 correction, and Q8 added to the open list.
- **What was re-checked:** every file:line the verifier flagged, every one added here, and every cite into a file that changed after Rev 2 was saved. They were checked against the code and docs as they stood at about 11:00 on 2026-10-03. The other cites point into files that have not changed since the Rev 2 verifier checked them.
- **Citations fixed:**
  - FrontRoomsSoundDirector.cs moved down one line: hum :333-336, lamp registration :256-259, FMOD `Level` :353, `DoorBroken` subscriber :440, Chase stinger filter :546.
  - VISUAL_CHAT_TASKS.md rows are now cited by ID as well as line, because that file keeps moving: WG2, R2 and Q2.
  - Fog is at FrontRoomsLook.cs:21, 48, 50.
  - The WebGL lens factor is at FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:1315.
  - The tier rows are at FrontRoomsLevelProfile.cs:164-171.
  - The lens collider is killed in `BuildFixture` at FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:1185.
  - Found during the re-check, in files edited after Rev 2: the revision guarantee is now at MAP_GENERATION.md:102, and 10_webgl_plan.md has its compile guard at :160 and the ×4–5 estimate at :120.
- **First dark, corrected inline (§4).** The beat now picks BFS depth 2–4 from `startDoorCell`. That is the 3rd–5th cell counting the door cell as 1, which is what Rev 1 meant. Rev 2's depth 3–5 was one cell too far.
- **Missed report items added:**
  - `Arrived` is now a pressure-field and trail trigger (R6, §4, §11.1 Step 6).
  - The `ModuleLamp.Off` early return limits `SetLampMode`, and a live mode change must reset the fixture's timers (§11.1 Step 1).
  - `ChunkBuilt` fires before rooms are dressed (§11.1 Step 6).
  - Arches are walkable for the Relay (R6).
  - The HUD settings copy already matches the decision (R14).
  - The upload is shared with the print's R channel, and the perf gate now states the acceptance baseline (§11.1 Budget).
- **Decided:**
  1. Lamp-override interface v1 is **agreed**. The map chat (关卡设计) builds it after its current audit work (§11.1 Step 1, §11.2).
  2. Red's **staged Relay warning** replaces every Relay-centred lamp effect. Its owner is 系统设计 (Documentation/RELAY_PURSUIT_REDESIGN.md). Nothing dims around the Relay, and the ink has no halo and no radar. In stage 1 the paper beside the player may gasp GROUND only, through a smooth burst gate (§7, R12, R15, §9). The OMEN wave goes with it (§14, Q8).
  3. Q3: the chase wave and pressure re-pointing fire on CHASE only.
  4. Q1: all Relay state text, CHASE and BREAKING DOOR included, stays hidden unless the one assist toggle is on.
  5. The narrative direction is **EGRESS** (30_narrative_phosphor.md §4). §12 is filled from it.
  6. The ink content follows **spec v1.2** (Tools/print/README.md, "Glow-ink textures (spec v1.2)"; the visual chat's Q2). That means one unmirrored type frame, layers 0–9 with the layer-9 GROUND scratch, a 768×1152 substance array and about 13.6 MB in total (R11, §8, §9, §11.1 Steps 4–5, §11.2, §12).
- **Still open for Red:** Q10 (now the placard), Q11 (escalation coupling), and Q2, Q5–Q9, Q12 and Q13 (§15).

Status: proposal only. First written 2026-10-02, then revised twice on 2026-10-03 (Rev 2 and Rev 3). None of the ink is implemented. Some things it builds on have landed: the P4 run tiers, the Relay-readout assist and the hooks listed as existing in §11.1 Step 6. The lamp-override interface v1 is agreed but not yet built. Written by the wallpaper-print chat (a judge-panel workflow: 4 directions, 3 judges per direction, all 4 scored). Most of the build would fall to the map chat (关卡设计), plus some work by the visual chat; see §11.2. Paths are relative to `Frontrooms3D/`. Every gameplay number is marked **SP** (a starting point for playtest). Code facts are given as file:line, as of the post-P4 code of 2026-10-03.

Base design: **Afterglow Blazes (wayfinding)**, which scored highest overall (23 / 30). Grafts taken from the others:
- **threat_intel:** retire the HUD distance readout, permanent BREACH scars, the EAR bloom, and the backlit Relay silhouette.
- **light_economy:** fresh-vs-starved charge physics, a first-dark beat where the lamp dies in view, the drought breaker, and the idea that meaning sits in a world-space mask while narrative owns the glyph substance.
- **anomaly_literacy:** glyph families by silhouette, the physical lie tell, and no strip slips under a readable mark.

## 1. Pitch and the player decision it adds

A hidden ZnS:Cu underprint in the Level 0 wallpaper shows only where a cell's own lamp is dead, dying or sagging. Lit walls show nothing, so every lit 3 m module stays identical. In the dark, the paper points:
- **FLOW** (chevrons) lies along the best route to the nearest threshold into a zone you have not visited.
- **HERE** (brackets) frames that door or window.
- **STOP** (bars) marks the mouth of a dead-end pocket.
- **BREACH** (a bracket crossed out) marks a door the Relay broke, which will never shut again.

When the Relay starts a chase, the lamps sag in a wave that runs down the corridors ahead of the player, and the marks in that wave re-point to doors leading away from it.

**The ink knows the building. It does not know the monster.** In calm play it ignores the Relay, so it can lead you straight into a wandering one. It never marks where the Relay is. Red's staged warning happens around the player, not the Relay: your room's lamps flicker, then you hear steps, then you hear a lock-on cue (§7). The ink's only part before a chase is a GROUND gasp on the paper beside you when your lamps flicker. Following it also roughly doubles your rate of new thresholds, and so of new zones, which speeds up run-tier escalation (the code counts new zones).

Decisions it adds:

| When | Decision | Cost of each answer |
|---|---|---|
| Calm | Follow the green to new ground, or go my own way? | Following means faster progress, faster escalation and a blind walk past the Relay. Ignoring it means slower progress and more dead ends. |
| Chase | Which door does the wave point at, and do I spend time reading the end wall? | Reading costs metres at 4.2 m/s (run tier 1; about 5.4 m/s at tier 5). A shut door buys 2.5 s + 0.25 s at run tier 1; the break shortens to about 1.3 s at tier 5. |
| Junction | Is that branch a pocket (STOP)? | Entering a pocket during a hunt is the cheapest death in the maze. |
| T4+ (run tier 5; on, §15 Q4) | Is this mark real? It is glowing under a lit lamp. | A forged FLOW leads into a dead end. |

## 2. Rules

1. **Gate.** `G = C × smoothstep(0.55, 0.15, Ls) × weight` (SP).
   - `Ls` is the cell's own lamp level, low-passed with τ 0.35 s (SP). The lamp level is the logical `Fixture.level`: a field at FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:111, in the private class `Fixture` (:98). Every frame it is recomputed as `f.level = Level(f)`, at :1277 in the desktop `TickFixtures` and at :1308 in the WebGL `TickFixturesNear`. `Level()` is at :1384 and switches on `f.mode`. The ink reads it through `LampLevel(cell)` from the lamp-override layer (§11.1 Step 1, interface v1 agreed), so active sags, dips and warning bursts count. Whether a warning burst pushes Ls past 0.55 depends on how long each dip holds, which RELAY_PURSUIT_REDESIGN.md leaves to the caller. With zero hold Ls stays near 0.66; with a 0.06–0.2 s hold it reaches 0.42–0.55. So the plain gate would open erratically, and bursts get their own gate (§7).
   - It must never be read from `light.enabled`, `light.intensity` or the lens emission. Those are cut by the distance fade and the start-area hold: desktop :1280-1284, WebGL :1309-1319, and the lens factor `f.level × held` at :1288 (desktop) and :1315 (WebGL).
   - lightRadius is 16 m (FrontRoomsLevelProfile.cs:37). The fade starts at 13 m, and from 16 m the Light is off, so reading the Light would make every cell beyond 16 m glow. On WebGL an off lamp also keeps a stale `light.intensity` (:1319), and far chunks force the fade to 0 (:1310-1311).
   - A lit cell (Ls ≥ 0.55) shows nothing.
2. **Charge physics. This never changes with tier** (run tier or generation tier).
   - Wall light (Proposed, SP): `W = min(1, L + 0.2 × Σ L of the 4 neighbours)`. The code has no per-cell light value and no neighbour sum.
   - The code fact behind it: a lamp without shadows lights straight through walls (comment at FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:1229-1236). Shadows are None at build (:1207). About 1 lamp in 3 gets `castsShadow` (:1215), and those cast soft shadows only within shadowRadius 9 m (:1285 desktop, :1320 WebGL; FrontRoomsLevelProfile.cs:39).
   - Real lamps reach further than the 4 neighbours: a 162° spot with a range of 10 m, or 12 m under ceilings above 4 m (:1202-1206). The 4-neighbour sum is a deliberate simplification. Building it needs the cell→fixture index of §11.1 Step 1.
   - When W > C, C rises toward W with τ 2 s.
   - Otherwise C decays hyperbolically, `C(t) = C₀ / (1 + C₀·t / 8 s)` (SP). This is the second-order recombination shape of real ZnS:Cu afterglow.
   - **Fresh** dark (a lamp that just died) is bright. **Starved** dark (a dead cell among dead neighbours) is faint or blank. Both follow from the physics, so neither looks like a bug.
3. **Carriers.** Only wallpaper carries ink: Level 0 walls and wallpapered columns (LEVEL_MODULE_SPEC.md:57-59). No ink appears on:
   - Office drywall (:58);
   - doors, trim, glass, floors or ceilings;
   - the start area. The code is at FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:456-484: `SetStartArea` :467, `InStartArea` :483; floor and ceiling are skipped at :813-814; the boundary walls come from `StartAreaEdge` :919-935.
     - Its west, east and south boundary walls carry the outside zone's wallpaper (:932-933). So the mask must also leave out every edge that touches the start area (`InStartArea` on either side), not only the cells inside it.
     - `ClearStartArea` (:479, called from FrontRooms3DGame.cs:808) hands the area back to the map once the stream rooms are gone. The exclusion therefore holds only while `HasStartArea` is true.
   - the title stream rooms (10_synthesis.md:217-218; line 218 is the mask rule). They share the map's `L0_Wallpaper` material (FrontRoomsSurfaces.cs:28; FrontRooms3DGame.cs:371-376, 401), so a material keyword alone would put ink on them. They need the per-cell ink-eligible bit (§11.1 Step 4) or a stream-only copy of the material. That includes the terminal room's end-wall facade, which faces the map.
4. **Messages and glyph families** (the shape is told by silhouette, not detail). Priority is STOP > HERE (or BREACH) > FLOW > GROUND.

   | Message | Family | Meaning | Weight (SP) |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | GROUND | neutral | Plain underprint, no direction | 0.35 |
   | FLOW (dir) | go: open chevrons | The route runs this way along this wall | 1.0 |
   | HERE | threshold: frame brackets | The route leaves through this face's door or window | 1.0 |
   | BREACH (a HERE variant) | stop: bracket with a cross bar | The Relay broke this door. It is passable and will never shut. | 1.0 |
   | STOP | stop: closed horizontal bars | This face is the mouth of a dead-end pocket | 1.0 |
   | Pressure variant (FLOW or HERE) | go or threshold, drawn doubled | Chase routing: a door away from the Relay | 1.0 |

   BREACH's rule is already code: a door the Relay breaks stays open and passable for the whole run (`BreakDoor`, FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:1146-1156; `brokenDoors` :229; `PassageBetween` :1134). Only the glyph is proposed.
5. **Calm target.** The nearest **new threshold**: a Door or Window edge whose far cell is in a zone not in `zonesVisited` (FrontRooms3DGame.cs:168; filled at :898-910, cleared at :626).
   - `zonesVisited` is a private `HashSet<GridCoord>` of `ZoneInfo.id`. It is filled only after the player leaves the start rooms, and it has no accessor yet (§11.1 Step 6).
   - Door and Window edges occur only where the zone height changes (FrontRoomsMap.cs:364-367). So a new zone of the same height, reached through an Arch or Open edge, never counts as a new threshold. Widening the rule to "any edge whose far cell's zone id is unvisited" would change that.
   - Unbroken windows cost +4 cells (SP), because breaking glass is loud:
     - At run tier 1 it is heard at 40 × 1.4 = 56 m (`GlassNoiseRadius`, FrontRooms3DGame.cs:156; `hearing`, FrontRoomsHunter.cs:32; applied as `radius × tuning.hearing` at FrontRoomsMapHunter.cs:292).
     - Since P4 the run tier multiplies hearing by 1 / 1.15 / 1.3 / 1.45 / 1.6 (FrontRoomsLevelProfile.cs:139, 164-171; FrontRooms3DGame.cs:1639-1643). That gives 56 / 64.4 / 72.8 / 81.2 / 89.6 m at run tiers 1–5.
     - The distance is straight-line XZ. Noise is ignored while the Relay is unreleased, chasing or breaking a door (FrontRoomsMapHunter.cs:291).
   - If `doorsNeedKeys` is on (FrontRoomsLevelProfile.cs:33; false in code and in FrontRoomsLevel0.asset:47), a Door target comes after the key of the zone the player is standing in. The exception is a door a key has already opened (FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:1913-1916).
     - Window targets are never key-gated, and tall zones have no key.
     - The map's working flag is private (:39). Read `Profile.doorsNeedKeys` or add a getter.
   - Calm routes never read the Relay's position.
6. **Pressure target. It is used only while the Relay is in Chase** (Red, Q3 answered 2026-10-03; this fixes the radar leak). Proposed: a new system hooked to `relay.StateChanged` (FrontRoomsMapHunter.cs:149; the game already subscribes at FrontRooms3DGame.cs:617).
   - When the Relay is relayed, `Arrived(Vector3, string)` fires (FrontRoomsMapHunter.cs:153, raised in `Appear` at :465). Its cell jumps, so `Arrived` also rebuilds the pressure field and restarts the trail samples below (§4).
   - **Target.** An unbroken door, open or player-shut (and not locked when `doorsNeedKeys` is on), whose far cell is farther from the Relay by breadth-first search than its near cell.
     - The Relay never shuts doors. Since Relay pursuit v2 it can OPEN doors, leaving them Ajar, and it can still break them; a broken door stays open (FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:1147-1156). Only the player shuts doors (`Use` → `SetDoor`, :1822-1834). An Ajar door counts as open here: it is a valid pressure target because the player can shut it.
     - The Relay-distance BFS is the ink's own. It runs from `world.CellOf(relay.Position)` over the public `PassageBetween` (:1121), `IsBuilt` (:633) and `DoorBetween` (:1144), because the hunter's own `Search`/`depth` are private (FrontRoomsMapHunter.cs:494-520).
   - **Route costs (SP):**
     - +6 per cell within 2 steps of the Relay;
     - +2 per cell on its open straight line within 4 cells;
     - +2 for cells it walked through in the last 10 s, sampled from `relay.Position` (the hunter keeps no trail). The samples restart on `Arrived`, so a relay never draws a trail across the map;
     - −1 per arch edge, **only when the Relay is not lined up with the arch's gap**. *Changed in Rev 2:* the bonus used to be unconditional, on the wrong premise that arches block sight. An arch narrows the Relay's view, but a ray through the gap passes: the gap is 1.1–1.8 m wide and 2.2 m tall, and both eyes sit at about 1.6 m (FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:978, 1084-1090; FrontRoomsMapHunter.cs:976-1002). The exact alternative is a raycast from the Relay's eye, as `Visible` does (:987).
       - Arches also cost the Relay nothing to walk through: `PassageBetween` returns Open for an Arch edge (FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:1129-1131), and its 2.05 m height fits under the 2.2 m arch top (`RelayHeight`, `ArchTop`; FrontRoomsModuleUnits.cs:94, 52). The bonus is about sight only, never about slowing it.
     - With a base step cost of 1, an arch step costs 0. A bucket queue handles that.
   - Windows and BREACH doors are never pressure targets.
   - **When pressure ends.** When the Relay enters Listen (Wander only ever follows Listen, FrontRoomsMapHunter.cs:220, 486), or 20 s (SP) after the Chase ends.
     - A Chase that goes into BreakDoor and then resumes Chase (:580-581, :953) has not ended.
     - A lost Chase normally runs Chase → Hunt → Search → Listen (:304, :392, :354).
     - Search alone lasts up to 15 s × the run tier's search factor, 1.0–1.6 (FrontRoomsLevelProfile.cs:141-142, 166-170). So the 20 s timer often ends pressure before Listen does.
     - Proposed in the pursuit redesign (RELAY_PURSUIT_REDESIGN.md §3): the new Withdraw and Away states would also end pressure.
7. **Only on-route cells point.** The route is a greedy descent of the target field, up to 24 cells (SP). At T0-T1 (run tiers 1–2) it also covers cells 1 step off the route. Every other dark cell shows GROUND.
   - Simulation of beacon-seeking walkers, in new zones per 100 cells: when every dark cell points, walkers ping-pong (2.4). On-route only gives 8.0. A random walker scores 5.6.
8. **STOP** marks the mouth cell of each dead-end branch.
   - Branches are found by iterative leaf pruning. Door and window edges count as passable, and the built-area boundary counts as open.
   - The maze has loops (non-tree edges roll Open or Arch at 18-70%, FrontRoomsMap.cs:94-96, 360), so pruning is the exact test. A branch BFS is not.
   - A FLOW route never enters a branch unless its target is inside it.
9. **Truth.** Before T4 (run tier 5) the ink never lies. It never points into a dead end, through a BREACH on the pressure route, or at the Relay's cell.
   - From T4 (run tier 5; on, Red §15 Q4; see §6), a **forged FLOW** may appear. It is the only mark that glows under a lit lamp, and only FLOW is ever forged.
10. **Commit gate.** A cell's message may change only when at least one of these holds:
    - (a) the cell has been unseen for ≥ 0.5 s;
    - (b) its own Ls ≥ 0.8, so the ink is invisible;
    - (c) a sag or wave front is at that cell (a deliberate beat).

    Each cell changes at most once per 2 s (SP). The glow *brightness* may change in view (that is physics). The *message* may not.
11. **Shape is procedural; the substance is a tier texture** (Rev 2: it is no longer in the print's B channel).
    - The message shape (`InkShape`) is computed in the shader from the world position plus the cell's message code.
    - The close-up content comes from two global Texture2DArrays. Both are fetched only inside the glow-mask branch. *Rev 3:* this is **spec v1.2** (2026-10-03). It supersedes v1, which Rev 2 described, and v1.1 is withdrawn. It is in Tools/print/README.md, "Glow-ink textures (spec v1.2)", and is queued as the visual chat's Q2 (VISUAL_CHAT_TASKS.md, row Q2, :128 at the time of writing). The content is EGRESS's frozen set (30_narrative_phosphor.md §A.11), rendered by `Tools/print/ink_tool.py`.
      - **`_FR_InkType`:** 1024², BC4, linear, mips, 16 layers (0–9 used), about 10.7 MB.
        - **One unmirrored frame for every type layer:** `u = dot(posWS, normalize(cross(N, up))) / 0.75` and `v = (h − 0.8 m) / 0.75`. Text reads left to right on both faces of a wall. Arrow direction still comes from the world axis and `FaceSign` (§9), never from this u.
        - **Layers:** 0 FLOW `THIS WAY OUT`; 1 FLOW from T2 `THIS WAY ON`; 2 HERE door `EXIT`; 3 HERE window `EXIT · BREAK GLASS`; 4 STOP `NO`/`EXIT` pairs; 5 BREACH `OUT OF SERVICE · DOES NOT CLOSE`; 6 pressure chevron `ALARM · THIS WAY OUT`; 7 pressure door `FIRE DOOR · KEEP CLOSED`; 8 forged `THIƧ WAY OUT` (hand-lettered); 9 GROUND scratch cluster. The CPU lookup `float4 _FR_InkTypeLayer[4]` (entries 0–9) picks the layer.
        - **Values:** layers 0–8 have a field of 1.0 and type at 0.55, and a stroke keeps a mean ≥ 0.6 in any 100 mm square. Layer 9 has a background of 0 and marks at 1.0.
      - **Layer 9 (GROUND scratch):** composited as `max(substance, scratch)`. It shows only when all of these hold:
        - the run tier is ≥ 4 (T3+);
        - the cell is a GROUND cell with `Hash(seed, cell & 63, 977) < 0.125`;
        - the pixel is on one hashed 0.75 m tile per face;
        - v ∈ [0, 1).
      - **`_FR_InkSubstance`:** 768×1152, BC4, 5 layers = run tiers 1–5, about 2.9 MB. It uses the warped print UV over one 0.75 × 1.125 m roll tile. The field is 0.7 and the marks 0.4 (the roll stamp `SHEET A-3 / A-4 / A-1114 OF 4`, and `OCCUPANTS 2` at tier 5). Its layer is chosen by `_FR_InkTier`, which the wallpaper driver sets on `TierChanged`.
      - **Total:** about 13.6 MB.
      - **WebGL:** substance only, at 384×576, or the B/A two-family fallback. The visual chat chooses.
    - What you see is the procedural shape filled with that content. The substance follows the run tier, not print slices, so print jumps never change the substance or the message. Because it is sampled with the warped print UV, it moves with the print's warp and drift. The type frame is world-fixed, like the shape.
    - The print's B channel is reserved and always 0. Red chose the WP03 "Hard edge" precise print, whose frames are R density, G cream, B 0.
    - Cells with a non-GROUND message take no lamp-dropout strip slips; their print changes only while unseen.
12. **Delivery channels.**
    - Natural dark cells (always on).
    - The first-dark beat (once per run).
    - Calm power sags (periodic, local).
    - The chase wave (rare).
    - The drought breaker (a safety net).
    - The EAR bloom (when the Relay accepts a noise).
    - The stage-1 gasp (Rev 3). It is GROUND only, on the paper beside the player, when the staged warning's burst darkens the player's room. It never shows a message and is never centred on the Relay (§7).
13. **Dark is never cover, and tall halls are not refuges.**
    - The Relay's sight is one 12 m eye-to-eye raycast (`tuning.sightRange`; tiers do not change it), with no light term (`Sees`, FrontRoomsMapHunter.cs:976-981; `Visible`, :987-1002; FrontRoomsHunter.cs:26).
    - Its speeds have no ceiling-height term. Ceiling height drives only the rig's poses and its ceiling-brush sound (FrontRooms3DGame.cs:1044; FrontRoomsRelayRig.cs:44-47, 204-209).
    - Since P4 the chase speed is multiplied by the run tier, ×1.00 to ×1.29, so it runs from 4.2 to about 5.4 m/s (FrontRoomsLevelProfile.cs:136-143, 164-171; FrontRooms3DGame.cs:1639-1643).
    - Nothing in the ink or its fiction may imply that dark hides you or that tall halls are safe.
14. **The HUD stops giving it away.** Done: Red decided this on 2026-10-03 and the map chat has landed it. Rev 3: fully answered (§15 Q1).
    - **All** Relay state text, CHASE and BREAKING DOOR included, and the distance readout are hidden by default. Only **one** assist toggle, RELAY READOUT, shows them. The player turns it on with Esc → O → T (pause screen, display settings). It is saved as `FrontRooms.Assist.RelayReadout` (FrontRooms3DGame.cs:91-94, 333, 1320-1326, 1564).
    - The HUD gate is `showThreat = play && released && relayReadout` (:1598-1600; panel at :1619).
      - With the assist off, nothing shows, CHASE and BREAKING DOOR included.
      - With it on, every state shows (LISTEN, HUNT, SEARCH, WANDER, CHASE, BREAKING DOOR), together with `RELAY nn M`.
    - No code change is needed. The settings copy ("THE RELAY'S STATE AND DISTANCE ON SCREEN", :1315) and the comment at :91-92 already describe this.
    - Threat now reaches the player through the staged warning (lamps, steps, the lock-on cue; §7), never through text.
15. **Photosafe by construction.**
    - Stutter-mode cells are forced to G = 0.
    - Ls is low-passed.
    - Each message changes at most once per 2 s.
    - Sags and waves are single dips with ramps ≥ 0.3 s.
    - Any lamp death in view dips at ≤ 2 Hz.
    - Rev 3: the stage-1 warning burst (`LampFx.Warn`) obeys the warning's own limit of ≤ 3 lamp changes per second (RELAY_PURSUIT_REDESIGN.md §7.4). The ink's gasp on it is one smooth rise and fall per burst, never one per dip (§7).
    - Reduce motion follows the one shared `FrontRoomsSettings.ReduceFlashing` setting, which is new and does not exist in the code yet (§9).
16. **Deterministic.** This is a requirement for the new ink code, not a description of today's code.
    - **Proposed:** every ink choice is hashed from (seed, cell & 63, event counters), with no `UnityEngine.Random` and no `_Time`. That needs the ink's own hash, with `cell & 63` and event-counter salts, layered on `MapHash.Hash(seed, x, y, salt, revision)` (FrontRoomsMap.cs:230-241). Today that hash takes full cell coordinates and no counters.
    - **Today:** map, lamp and Relay choices are hashed or xorshift-drawn from the run seed. Lamps use salt 211 (FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:1178), and the Relay seeds its own xorshift (FrontRoomsMapHunter.cs:161).
      - No project shader uses `_Time`.
      - `UnityEngine.Random` is used in three places only: it picks the run seed (FrontRooms3DGame.cs:548; FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:338), varies Foley pitch (FrontRooms3DGame.cs:1137) and picks the editor autopilot's goal (:1982).
    - Two inputs are not a pure function of (seed, cell):
      - Lamp levels run on a per-fixture clock (`f.clock += dt`) that restarts when a chunk is rebuilt.
      - A lamp's temperament depends on its chunk's generation tier (`MapChunk.tier`), which depends on when the player got there (FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:1219-1221; FrontRooms3DGame.cs:898-917).
    - So the guarantee is: the same seed plus the same input and timing history gives the same ink timeline (synthesis P3 gate). This revision accepts that, because forged FLOW reads the run tier (§6).

## 3. Placement and generation per zone and tier

Nothing is hand-placed. Every message is derived per cell from two sources:
- **Map data that does not change with revision:** zones, border edges and keys (MAP_GENERATION.md:102).
- **The lamp temperament roll.**
  - It starts from `MapHash.Hash(seed, cell.x, cell.y, 211)` (FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:1178). The odds of the chunk's generation tier turn it into a mode, `tierRules.At(MapChunk.tier).LampMode(roll)` (:1218-1221), unless a room module sets the lamp (:1223).
  - Since P4 it is not known from the seed alone. For an unbuilt cell, `LampModeOf(cell)` (§11.1 Step 1) is exact once the cache has generated the chunk. Before that it is a prediction at the current generation tier.

Routes are recomputed whenever a chunk is rebuilt. Streaming rebuilds a shifted chunk only when it is at least one chunk (24 m) away (FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:703-710). The Level Designer's live `RebuildChunk`/`ReplaceModule` (:310-331) can rebuild anywhere, but only in the editor.

**Beacon sources, measured in a Python port of the generator (12-16 seeds; it skips modules, columns and the start area).** These were measured with the pre-P4 lamp odds, which are generation tier 1's (62/20/10/5/3). At generation tier 5 the odds are 40/25/18/12/5 (FrontRoomsLevelProfile.cs:164-171), so failing, dead and dim cells rise from about 18% to 35%.
- **Lamp temperaments:** 62.3% steady, 20.1% stutter, 9.5% failing, 5.0% dead, 3.1% dim.
- **Effective beacon cells** (failing, dead or dim): 17.6%.
  - The nearest beacon is a mean of 1.84 cells from any cell (p90 is 4).
  - On walked routes, a readable beacon comes every ~6 cells (18 m).
- **Thresholds are plentiful:** a cell is a mean 3.1 cells from a door or window. The nearest *new* threshold is typically 3-7 cells away.
- **Dead-end branches:** 31 per 1,000 cells, 70% of them 1-cell alcoves. That is about 50 in a 5×5-chunk area, about 15 of them with depth ≥ 2.

**Hint strength (150-cell walks, 16 seeds):**

| Walker | New zones / 100 cells | New thresholds / 100 cells |
|---|---|---|
| Random | 5.6 | 3.1 |
| On-route ink | 8.0 | 6.1 |
| Perfect knowledge | 15.1 | 12.5 |
| Continuous 3-cell route dimming (rejected: a GPS) | 14.7 | not measured |

**Per zone** (shares from FrontRoomsMap.cs:82-84, 117):

| Zone | Share of zones | Ink | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Standard Level 0, 2.9 m | ~38% | Full | Long corridors. Decisions are read on end walls at T-junctions. |
| Low, 2.4 m | ~35% | Full | Short sightlines and many facing walls: the best near-read zone. Doors sit on its borders. |
| Tall hall, 5.4 m | ~10% | Full, glow band 0.8-2.0 m | Exits are windows only, so calm HERE marks windows. Lamps run ×1.6 with range 12, so neighbour spill is high: dead cells read bright, and lookdev must check the paper contrast. |
| Office, 2.9 m | ~17% of zones (13.6% of cells) | None (drywall) | Deliberate blind stretches. Routes add +1 per Office cell (SP), so the ink prefers paper. |

**Room modules.** Level Designer modules can author ModuleLamp Dead/Failing/Off per cell (FrontRoomsRoomModuleData.cs:30). `BuildFixture` applies the override at FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:1223, and an Off lamp returns early at :1176.
- Recommended: at most 1 dark "reading room" per 4 chunks (SP).
- Off cells get no fixture at all. L = 0 for good, so they are starved and show no ink. A persistent `SetLampMode` cannot revive or promote them either, because there is no fixture to change (§11.1 Step 1).

**Optional "border dusk" lever.** Cells beside door or window edges get higher failing and dead odds.
- *Changed in Rev 2:* this is now an increment on each generation-tier row of `FrontRoomsTier` (SP: failing +15 points, dead +5 points). At generation tier 1 that gives the original 25% / 10% instead of 10% / 5%. The fixed 25% / 10% rested on the single pre-P4 odds table. At generation tiers 4–5 the base dead odds (10%, 12%) already match or beat 10%, so the fixed version would add nothing there, or even lower the dead odds.
- It is a build-time change to the odds at FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:1221, read by generation tier. It is not a runtime override.
- Use it only if playtest shows HERE is too rare. Naturally, only 14% of exit-adjacent cells are dark themselves (measured at generation tier 1).
- It needs visual-chat sign-off. LEVEL_MODULE_SPEC.md:76 still calls flicker odds the visual chat's numbers, yet P4 already moved them into the level profile's tier table (FrontRoomsLevelProfile.cs:121-125, 164-171) without a recorded sign-off.

**Storage.**
- 64×64 toroidal arrays indexed `(x & 63) + 64·(y & 63)`, with a 192 m period (10_synthesis.md:131).
- The built window is 40×40, or 56×56 at buildRadius 3. buildRadius is `[Range(1,3)]` with a default of 2 (FrontRoomsLevelProfile.cs:26-27), so the window never aliases.
- A chunk's texels are cleared on build and on drop.
- Persistent per-cell sets survive chunk drops, like `brokenDoors` (FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:229). They hold the persistent lamp modes from `SetLampMode` (the first-dark kill and the drought-breaker promote). BREACH needs no set of its own, because it can be derived from `brokenDoors` at build (§4).

Tier effects on placement are in §6.

## 4. Triggers, charge/decay and timing

**Per frame, per built cell (CPU).** Compute L, Ls, W, C and G as in R1-R2.

On chunk build (the new `ChunkBuilt`, §11.1 Step 6), C starts at its steady state (SP):

| Temperament | Initial C |
|---|---|
| Steady | 1.0 |
| Stutter | 1.0 |
| Failing | 0.75 |
| Dim | 0.5 |
| Dead | W (spill equilibrium) |
| Off | 0 |

Visibility thresholds (SP):
- **Beacon:** G ≥ 0.08, a green patch visible from about 20 m.
- **Legible:** G ≥ 0.25, the shape reads at 12-20 m head-on.

**What each temperament does.** The levels come from `Level()` (FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:1384-1416), which both tick paths call (desktop :1277, WebGL :1308). P4 changed only how often each temperament is rolled, set by the chunk's generation tier (`BuildFixture` :1221; odds at FrontRoomsLevelProfile.cs:164-171). The levels themselves did not change.

| Temperament | Lamp level | Ink |
|---|---|---|
| Steady (:1413-1414) | 0.98 (±0.02 shimmer) | Nothing. A full battery for its neighbours. Share: 62% at generation tier 1, 40% at tier 5. |
| Stutter (:1389-1397) | 0.95/0.05 bursts while Perlin(t·23) > 0.45. Each burst lasts 0.15–0.85 s, every 5–20 s; 0.97 ± 0.03 between bursts. | Forced G = 0, so it never flickers ink. Share: 20–25% by generation tier. |
| Failing (:1398-1402) | 0.25-0.70 at ~0.49 Hz (depth set by a ~0.20 Hz envelope), with Perlin dropouts to ~0.01–0.035 | Breathes: about 1 s readable every ~2 s. Full reads during dropouts. Share: 10–18%. |
| Dead (:1403-1410) | 0, with 0.8 blinks of 0.06–0.18 s, the next one 8-28 s after the last (the first 2–16 s after build, :1225) | Spill-charged steady glow. With 2 lit neighbours, C ≈ 0.39 (legible). In a dark cluster it is starved (blank). Share: 5–12%. |
| Dim (:1411-1412) | 0.42 (±0.03 at ~14 Hz; Ls ≈ 0.42 after the low-pass) | The gate is ≈ 0.25, so G ≈ 0.25 × C × weight. For weight-1 messages that is about 0.10 when isolated (C ≈ 0.42), 0.12 at the starting C of 0.5, and up to 0.25 with lit neighbours (C → 1). GROUND stays ≤ 0.087. Above Beacon, at or below Legible: a short-range read (~5 m is a design estimate). Share: 3–5%. |

**Fields and route.**
- The target field and the STOP pruning are rebuilt on any of:
  - `KeyTaken`, `DoorMoved`, `DoorBroken`, `GlassBroken` (FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:72-78), plus a new `ZoneEntered`. Proposed: a static event on FrontRooms3DGame, which owns zone tracking (§11.1 Step 6);
  - `relay.StateChanged` (FrontRoomsMapHunter.cs:149);
  - `relay.Arrived(Vector3, string)` (FrontRoomsMapHunter.cs:153, raised in `Appear` at :465). A relay moves the Relay's cell at once, so it rebuilds the pressure field and restarts the trail samples (R6). It is the only signal of such a teleport;
  - `TierChanged` (run tier, FrontRooms3DGame.cs:47), for the per-tier columns of §6;
  - `ChunkBuilt` / `ChunkDropped` (new, §11.1 Step 6);
  - a mode switch. This is the calm ↔ pressure switch inside the wayfinding class, derived from `StateChanged` and the 20 s timer. No map change is needed for it.
  - The staged warning (§7) is not a trigger. The stage-1 gasp reaches the ink only through `LampLevel` and `LampBaseLevel`, which it polls anyway, and nothing re-points.
- Rebuilds are rate-limited to 2 Hz (SP) and never run in a chunk-build frame (deferred one frame).
  - Events are coalesced with a dirty flag: `RebuildChunk` fires a drop and a build for one chunk in one call, and `Begin` can fire dozens of builds in one frame.
- The route is re-descended whenever the player changes cell (~0.94 s at the 3.2 m/s walk).
- Target stickiness: keep the current threshold until it is reached, or until it is ≥ 6 cells worse than the best alternative (SP).

**First-dark beat.** Proposed. It happens once per run. It replaces the earlier idea of a pre-dead cell, which is not in the code either.
- **Trigger:** after the start door shuts (MAP_GENERATION.md:23-24; FrontRooms3DGame.cs:779-789, `TerminalDoorShut`), and within 45 s (SP; no such timer exists yet).
  - Proposed in Rev 3: once the staged warning exists, the beat also waits for `WarnStage` 0. Then the lesson "ink appears where light dies" never overlaps "your lamps flicker: it is near". Under the pursuit redesign the Relay stays Dormant until something first calls it, so this rarely delays the beat.
- **Cell (Rev 2: chosen by path distance).**
  - The code guarantees only two connected cells. Cell 1 is the door's cell, `startDoorCell`: the map cell just outside the start door (FrontRooms3DGame.cs:564). Cell 2 is the cell beyond it, `ahead`. The edge between them is never Wall or Window, so it is Open, Arch or a Door (FrontRooms3DGame.cs:674-676).
  - `LeadsIntoMaze` (:691-710) proves that 150+ cells are reachable, but not that they lie in a straight line. A wall can stand right after cell 2, so cells 3–5 straight ahead are not guaranteed.
  - So at Space time the beat runs a breadth-first search with parent links over `PassageBetween`, starting at `startDoorCell` (depth 0, cell 1).
    - `ahead` is at depth 1. So is any side neighbour joined to the door cell by an open edge.
    - It picks a cell at **depth 2–4** whose target is ≤ 6 cells beyond it. That is the 3rd–5th cell, counting the door cell as 1, as Rev 1 intended.
    - *Corrected in Rev 3:* Rev 2 said depth 3–5, which is cells 4–6, one cell further than intended.
  - No generator change is needed.
  - The alternative was to force a straight line in `MapRootFor`. That would shrink the set of candidate roots and need a new 100-seed check.
- **Start-group lamp hold.**
  - Lamps within light range of the start area, at or north of the door line, are `startGroup` 1 (FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:1241-1251). While the player is in the start rooms they are held dark through `StartLampsNorth` (FrontRooms3DGame.cs:609). They rise with the door swing over 0.6 s (:124, :778) and are forced to 1 once the door is shut (:795).
  - The chosen cell will probably be in that group, so the beat must never fire before the shut. The trigger above guarantees that.
  - The hold sits outside `f.level` (:1280, :1309). The ink's Ls never sees it; only the visible lamp does.
- Its message commits while it is still lit (R10b).
- **The lamp death.** When the player is 6-9 m away and facing it, the lamp dies over 1.5 s. It makes three dips at ≤ 2 Hz, each a `SetLampOverride(cell, LampFx.Dip, multiplier, hold, env)` with an explicit short envelope in place of Dip's default. Then the lamp is off for the run (`SetLampMode(cell, Off)`, persistent; §11.1 Step 1). Under `ReduceFlashing` it becomes a single 1.5 s fade (§9).
  - It goes "off", not "Dead". In the code, Dead (mode 3) still blinks to 0.8 every 8–28 s (:1403-1410), and `ModuleLamp.Off` exists only at build time (:1176). So the layer needs a new runtime off mode.
- The trigger logic (picking the cell, the distance and facing test, the once-per-run flag) lives in FrontRooms3DGame, which owns the start-door timing (:779-795), or in the wayfinding class.
- C = 1, so it blooms bright, then settles to its spill glow.

**Power sag.** Proposed: a calm pacing pulse. No sag exists in the code.
- **Frequency:** every 75-120 s at T0 (run tier 1) (SP).
- **Spacing from waves.** *Changed in Rev 2:* no sag starts within 30 s after a wave starts. That is the low end of the synthesis's 30–45 s subliminal-only window after a wave (10_synthesis.md:168). The old "never within 30 s of a wave" could not hold before a wave, because the wave fires on an unpredictable Chase. A wave that starts during a sag replaces the sag.
- **Never in Office.** No sag while the player stands in an Office zone. The check is `map.ZoneOf(map.CellOf(playerRoot.position)).theme == ZoneTheme.Office`, already used at FrontRooms3DGame.cs:1876. Also none while `inStartRooms`.
- **Never over a warning** (Rev 3, proposed). No sag starts while `WarnStage` ≥ 1, so a sag is never mistaken for, or hides, the stage-1 flicker in the player's room.
- **Shape:** a breadth-first search over `PassageBetween`, 4 cells around the player. That is up to 12 m of walking distance, not a 12 m circle. Lamps dip through `SetLampOverride(cell, LampFx.Sag, 0.35, hold 4 s, env: attack 1.6 s, release 1.5 s)`. The envelope is passed explicitly (Rev 4).
- **Stage-0 invariant (RELAY v2 §9.2):** at stage 0, no two lamps of the player's room set may start an override within 0.2 s of each other with an attack under 1.5 s.
- Sags run at stage 0, so their attack is 1.6 s and they meet the invariant for any number of lamps at once.
- The landed Dip/Sag defaults are not used here.
- All messages in the radius commit at dip start. It is a snapshot, never a trail.
- **Needs:** a sag scheduler, a last-wave timestamp, and the per-run-tier intervals of §6.

**Chase wave.** Proposed: the synthesis's corridor wave (10_synthesis.md:143-144, 167). No wave exists in the code.
- **Trigger:** `relay.StateChanged(Chase)` (`event Action<HunterState>`, FrontRoomsMapHunter.cs:149, raised only by `SetState` :1004-1012). It fires on CHASE only (Red, Q3 answered 2026-10-03).
  - It fires only when the previous state was not BreakDoor. The Chase stinger uses the same filter (FrontRoomsSoundDirector.cs:546). Without it, the Chase that resumes after a door break (FrontRoomsMapHunter.cs:953) would start a second wave.
  - Under the staged warning, the stage-3 lock-on cue plays first and CHASE begins when it ends. The stage-1 flicker stops at stage 3, so the wave takes over the player's lamps on CHASE and the two never overlap (RELAY_PURSUIT_REDESIGN.md §7).
  - It also fires only if the cooldown has passed (90 s at T0 = run tier 1, SP).
  - Subscribe through `FrontRooms3DGame.MapRunStarted` (FrontRooms3DGame.cs:39).
- **The front.** *Changed in Rev 4 (RELAY v2 §9.2):* it starts at the **player's room set**, never at the Relay's cell. It runs outward at 8 m/s (SP), which is 0.375 s per 3 m cell (FrontRoomsMap.cs:52), over built cells (`IsBuilt`), and reaches 10 cells from the player (SP). The pressure messages it commits still use the Relay-distance BFS for direction (doors leading away from the Relay), but the lamps never reveal where the Relay is.
  - It crosses only edges where `PassageBetween` is Open. Never use `MapGrid.Passable` here, because it lets the front through unbroken glass.
  - It waits 0.5 s (a free tuning value) at a `Passage.ClosedDoor`.
  - That uneven door cost makes it a time-ordered expansion (Dijkstra-style or bucketed), not a plain BFS.
- **Lamps.** Each lamp dips through `SetLampOverride(cell, LampFx.Dip, 0.3, hold 2.5 s, env: attack 0.3 s, release 1.2 s)`, called as the front arrives. The envelope is passed explicitly (Rev 4).
  - The wave fires only on CHASE (stage 3), so the stage-0 invariant does not apply.
  - Even so, the front reaches one lamp per cell at least 0.375 s apart, which is more than 0.2 s. There is no `delay` argument: the wave schedules the calls itself. Pressure messages commit as the front arrives. Under `ReduceFlashing` the wave becomes a static sag (§9).
- **Speed.** 8 m/s outruns the 5.5 m/s sprint (FrontRooms3DGame.cs:153) and the run-tier-5 Relay (4.2 × 1.29 ≈ 5.4 m/s).
- **Lead (Rev 4).** The front now starts at the player, so the corridor ahead dims at once and the Rev 2 lead problem is gone. At 8 m/s against a 5.5 m/s sprint, the front is about 12.5 m ahead after 5 s and keeps widening, up to the 10-cell reach.
  - Also open: count the 10-cell reach from the player's current cell, not from their cell at wave start. A sprinter covers 27.5 m in 5 s.
- The same front also carries the visible print reprint, which needs the R2 print layer in main (§11.4).
- A door break takes 2.5 s only at run tier 1. The tier multiplier (1 → 0.52) brings it to about 1.3 s at tier 5 (FrontRoomsHunter.cs:21; FrontRoomsLevelProfile.cs:166-170).

**Drought breaker.** Proposed.
- **Trigger:** no legible sighting for 60 s, and the Relay is not pursuing: `relay.State` (FrontRoomsMapHunter.cs:118) is not Hunt, Chase or BreakDoor (SP). Rev 3, proposed: also none while `WarnStage` ≥ 1, so a new failing lamp is never read as part of a warning.
  - BreakDoor sits inside a Hunt or a Chase (:580-581, :953). Leaving it out would let the breaker fire during a door break.
  - Open: should Search, which follows a lost chase, also block it?
- "Legible sighting" needs a new sighting tracker. It is frustum-only until the visibility class of §11.1 Step 3 exists.
- **Action:** promote one unseen Steady cell, 4-8 cells ahead on the current route, to Failing with the persistent `SetLampMode(cell, Failing)`. At most once per 90 s (SP).
  - Such a cell is always in a built chunk (buildRadius ≥ 1), so the mode must change on the live fixture as well as at build.
  - Never use `RebuildChunk` for this (:319-330). It redresses the whole chunk, causes a frame spike and may be seen.
- In the simulation, natural beacons come every ~6 cells, so this should rarely fire. It exists for Office-heavy and starved seeds. At high generation tiers the lamps are darker, so it will fire even less.

**EAR bloom** ("it heard you"; P2). Proposed.
- **Trigger:** `ListenPoint` takes a new non-null value, which means a Noise was accepted. `Noise` is at FrontRoomsMapHunter.cs:289-296, and :293 is the only place `ListenPoint` gets a value. The guards are at :291 (Dormant, Chase, BreakDoor) and :292 (the hearing radius).
- **Bloom:** the dark cells among the source cell and its open neighbours raise their GROUND weight from 0.35 to 1.0 over a 1.5 s ramp. The bloom holds while `ListenPoint` still equals that source, then decays with τ 4 s.
- **Polling.** The hunter raises no "heard" event, so the bloom polls `relay.ListenPoint` each frame against the last value, the way `UpdateRelayRig` reads it (FrontRooms3DGame.cs:1042).
  - A second accepted noise from exactly the same position does not register. An optional `Heard(Vector3)` event raised at :293 would fix that (about 2 lines).
  - `ListenPoint` is cleared on sight (:204) and in `Appear` (:463), which raises `Arrived` (:465). Either one ends a bloom's hold.
- At most one bloom per 4 s, because sprint steps call `Noise` a little more than every 0.3 s of movement (FrontRooms3DGame.cs:886-894, the call at :893).
- It is the only ink change allowed to start in view.
- No new EAR can start during Chase or BreakDoor, because `Noise` returns early then (:291). A bloom that was already holding when the Relay went from Hunt into BreakDoor may keep holding, since `ListenPoint` is not cleared there (:575-581).

**BREACH.** Proposed. No ink, mark or wall-face code exists.
- When `FrontRoomsMapWorld.DoorBroken` fires (declared at :76, raised in `BreakDoor(Door, Vector3)` at :1146-1156), mark the faces of that door's wall in both cells with the BREACH variant. It is permanent and committed under R10.
- `DoorBroken` carries only the door's position (`Action<Vector3>`). Two map-side changes are coming:
  - Doors become single-acting next (Red's decision).
  - The map chat is adding a break-direction event beside `DoorBroken`.
- BREACH should take the door's edge and cells from the new event if it carries them. Otherwise, read them from `DoorBetween(a, b)` or the `Door` itself (`a`, `b`, `edge`, `broken`; :124-137). Changing `DoorBroken` itself would also mean updating its sound subscriber (FrontRoomsSoundDirector.cs:440).
- Permanence needs no new store. Derive the mark at chunk build from the existing `brokenDoors` set (:229), the way the door rebuild re-applies the broken state (:1029). A public `IsBrokenDoor(a, b)` read accessor would serve the packer (§11.1 Step 4).

**Caught.** Proposed requirement: on Caught the ink must freeze, and in the title stream rooms G = 0.
- **What Caught stops today:** the player, the Relay (FrontRoomsMapHunter.cs:166), the zone and tier clock, and all sound.
- **What keeps running:** `FrontRoomsMapWorld.Update` (:653-670) keeps streaming, flickering lamps (`TickFixtures` :1268) and swinging doors (:1921). The 98%-opaque CAUGHT overlay only hides the world (FrontRooms3DGame.cs:1521-1522).
- So the wayfinding tick needs its own freeze. It subscribes to `relay.Caught` (FrontRoomsMapHunter.cs:151) through `MapRunStarted`, as the sound director does. If the lamp levels that feed Ls and C must freeze too, `TickFixtures` and `TickFixturesNear` need the same gate, or `f.level` is snapshotted at the catch.
- In the stream rooms, G = 0 comes from the R3 mask, not from any code that exists today.

## 5. Teaching curve

No HUD tutorial by default. Every lesson is a staged beat.

**First 5 minutes:**

| Time | Beat | Lesson | Guaranteed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0-3 s | The stream door opens (MAP_GENERATION.md:21). The maze lamps by the door rise in 0.6 s (FrontRooms3DGame.cs:124, 778). | Lit Level 0 looks normal. | The current start flow |
| ~5-45 s | **First dark:** a lamp dies in view 6-9 m ahead, and chevrons bloom on the side walls with FLOW or HERE on the end wall. In today's code the Relay is already out by then: it is released 3 s after the door shuts, 9-15 cells away (MAP_GENERATION.md:34; FrontRoomsMapHunter.cs:49). Under the pursuit redesign it stays Dormant until first called. Either way the beat waits for `WarnStage` 0 (§4). | Ink appears where light dies, and green points somewhere. | The first-dark beat |
| ~20-60 s | Following the chevrons ends at a door or window. The ceiling height changes and `ZONE 02` appears (FrontRooms3DGame.cs:1595). | Green leads to new ground. | Target ≤ 6 cells |
| ≤ 2 min | The first natural failing cell, breathing. | Wait for the gasp to read. | Drought breaker |
| 1-2 min | The first STOP at a junction (a 1-cell alcove at T0-T1, run tiers 1–2). | Bars mean a pocket. | Branch density (~50 in range) |
| 75-120 s | The first power sag: every wall within 12 m of walking flares for 4 s. | Sags give a snapshot of the whole neighbourhood. | Sag timer |
| First accepted sprint (P2) | EAR bloom on your own trail. | It heard you; leave quietly. | EAR |
| First stage-1 warning (Rev 3) | The Relay comes within about 30 m of walking. Your room's lamps flicker together in bursts, and on a deep burst the paper beside you gasps GROUND, with no message. | Lamps flickering around you mean it is near. The walls still do not say where it is. | The staged warning (系统设计) and the burst gate (§7) |
| First chase | The wave runs past the player, and doubled chevrons point to a door. Once the staged warning exists, the lock-on cue plays first. | Under pressure, the walls point to a door you can shut. | Wave (first chase is always past the cooldown) |

**First 3 runs (targets to validate):**
- **Run 1:** green = new ground; STOP = pocket. Notices the dark-only rule.
- **Run 2:** uses the chase wave and shuts doors. Learns that a starved dark cluster is blank (the physics rule) and that Office is blind.
- **Run 3:** scans the ceiling line for dead troffers. Reads end walls at 20 m and side walls within 6-8 m. Starts *choosing against* the ink (it is a lure as well as help). Recognises BREACH as a dead door.
- Lies (T4 = run tier 5) are expected only after run 3. Under the code's counting, run tier 5 comes at the 17th new zone, or after four 120 s stalls without one (FrontRoomsLevelProfile.cs:183, 160). At the ~3.6 zones per minute a random walker ticks, that is about 5 min in (an estimate), not the 8+ min assumed before Rev 2.

**Fallback:** if fewer than 50% of first-time players follow a FLOW within 60 s, add one Flash line written by narrative on the first beacon read. It names no symbols. EGRESS supplies "WHERE THE LIGHT DIES, THE PAPER POINTS" (30_narrative_phosphor.md §6). `Flash()` is at FrontRooms3DGame.cs:1633, and the line shows in the hint card at :1603.

**Optional legend, now the placard (Rev 3, from EGRESS; §15 Q10).** This replaces Rev 1's legend stream room. It is a framed evacuation-plan placard on the map side of the start door. It shows `YOU ARE HERE`, a start room and `SEE SHEET A-3`, and its glow legend lights only when its lamp is off (30_narrative_phosphor.md §A.2). It is a prop with its own InkShape legend, not wallpaper, and it sits outside the stream rooms. So it needs no exception to the stream-room mask. Red has to say yes or no.

## 6. Escalation over a run

The physics, gate and grammar never change, so what the player learns stays true. Escalation comes from scarcity, pacing, darker lamps, Relay tuning, and the late lie.

**Tier convention (Rev 2).**
- **Run tier.** Every tier in this doc is the run tier unless it says otherwise: `static FrontRooms3DGame.TierChanged(int)` (FrontRooms3DGame.cs:47), 1–5.
  - It fires 1 at run start (:636) and again on each rise in `RaiseTier` (:1645-1657). It never lowers.
  - T0–T4+ here are run tiers 1–5. The ink tier is the run tier − 1, and T4+ is tier 5 (`MaxTier`).
  - The run tier rises every 4 new zone ids, or by one after 120 s without a new zone (FrontRooms3DGame.cs:898-917; `FrontRoomsTierRules`, FrontRoomsLevelProfile.cs:155-190).
- **Generation tier.** The per-chunk generation tier (`MapChunk.tier`, FrontRoomsMap.cs:158) is stamped from `GenerationTier`/`Cache.Tier` when the cache first generates the chunk. It sets only that chunk's lamp odds and module tier. The ink reads it in two places only: `LampModeOf` and the border-dusk odds (§3).
- The ink columns below become fields on the existing `FrontRoomsTier` rows, read with `FrontRoomsTierRules.At(runTier)` (§11.4 S6).

| Tier (run tier) | Route beacons | Weight (SP) | Sag every | Wave cooldown | Wave reach ahead | STOP outside waves | Forged FLOW |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T0 (1) | on-route + 1 off | 1.0 | 75-120 s | 90 s | 10 cells | all branches | none |
| T1 (2) | on-route + 1 off | 1.0 | 90-150 s | 120 s | 10 cells | all branches | none |
| T2 (3) | on-route | 0.9 | 120-180 s | 150 s | 8 cells | depth ≥ 2 | none |
| T3 (4) | on-route | 0.85 | 150-210 s | 180 s | 6 cells | depth ≥ 2 | none |
| T4+ (5) | on-route, within 15 cells of target only | 0.8 | 180-240 s | 240 s | 6 cells | depth ≥ 2 | ≤ 1 per 4 chunks; the metrics are a kill switch |

- The weight floor stays at 0.8, so the 20 m head-on read survives at every tier (a brief constraint).
- **Close-up content by run tier** (Rev 3; EGRESS run arc, 30_narrative_phosphor.md §A.7; spec v1.2, R11). None of it changes a shape, a rule or a route.
  - T0 (1): `THIS WAY OUT`, `EXIT`, `NO`/`EXIT` and the roll stamp `SHEET A-3 OF 4`.
  - T1 (2): the stamp reads `SHEET A-4 OF 4`.
  - T2 (3): FLOW switches to `THIS WAY ON` (type layer 1, by rewriting the `_FR_InkTypeLayer` entry), and the stamp reads `SHEET A-1114 OF 4`.
  - T3 (4): the layer-9 scratch cluster appears on about 1 GROUND cell in 8.
  - T4+ (5): the stamp reads `OCCUPANTS 2`, and forged FLOW appears.
  - The substance layer switches on `TierChanged` through `_FR_InkTier`. The type switch at T2 is the CPU lookup.
- **Darker lamps by generation tier (P4, landed).** Chunks generated at higher tiers have more failing, dead and dim lamps: 40/25/18/12/5 at tier 5, against 62/20/10/5/3 at tier 1 (FrontRoomsLevelProfile.cs:164-171). That means more beacons but fewer lit neighbours, so more starved cells. The result is more hints, each harder to read. This is consistent with R2.
- **Forged FLOW** (T4+ = run tier 5; on, Red §15 Q4):
  - It reads the run tier (`TierChanged`), not the chunk's generation tier. So once the run reaches tier 5, a chunk generated earlier can still carry a forgery.
  - It sits in a lit Steady cell at an unmarked branch mouth and points into the branch.
  - The CPU writes G = 0.8 regardless of Ls, so it glows under full light. That is the tell. Up close the type is the hand-lettered `THIƧ WAY OUT` (layer 8). In EGRESS it is the other occupant's work, "too bright to be paper" (30_narrative_phosphor.md §A.3).
  - Only FLOW is forged. HERE, STOP and BREACH are always true, so the "stop" words stay trustworthy, and a caught lie itself reveals a pocket.
  - It never appears in pressure mode, and never twice on one route.
- **Escalation coupling** (flagged for Red):
  - Following the ink gives about 2× new thresholds per minute, so ink followers tier up faster. This is deliberate: the ink is help and lure at once.
  - Since P4 the code counts 4 new zone ids per tier (`TierForZones`, FrontRoomsLevelProfile.cs:183). About 45% of walkable zone crossings are invisible same-height crossings, so zones tick about 3.6 per minute even for a random walker.
  - Suggestion (SP): count tiers by new thresholds instead, 6 per tier or 2.5 min, whichever comes first. That would need new code in the zone loop (FrontRooms3DGame.cs:898-917); still open, §15 Q2.
  - The pursuit redesign proposes something else: count 150 new cells per tier, and drop the 120 s stall rise (RELAY_PURSUIT_REDESIGN.md §0 and §14, its Q3). Ink followers still reach new cells faster, so the coupling holds under any of the three counts. Q2 and Q11 should be decided together with that question.
- **Never escalates:** truth before T4, BREACH permanence, the dark-only rule, R13.

## 7. Interaction with the Relay and the escape verbs

| Fact (code) | Ink behaviour |
|---|---|
| Sight is one 12 m ray with no light term, and tiers do not change it (FrontRoomsMapHunter.cs:976-1002) | Darkness, sags and waves change only what the player knows. The wave also darkens the player's own view of the Relay, which is a real cost. The dark body (#2B2928) with its pale head (D8D4C8) (FrontRooms3DGame.cs:276) silhouettes against glowing paper: a free scare, not a stealth rule. |
| Wander never crosses shut doors (FrontRoomsMapHunter.cs:473-487; its search treats doors as closed, :511-512) | Calm routes ignore the Relay, so a shut door the ink led you through also shields you from a wanderer. That is emergent, not promised. |
| Hunt and Chase plan through doors and break them in 2.5 s + 0.25 s at run tier 1, about 1.3 s at tier 5 (FrontRoomsHunter.cs:21; FrontRoomsLevelProfile.cs:166-170; MAP_GENERATION.md:36) | Pressure routes end at a door away from the Relay (HERE, doubled). After the player passes and shuts it, the next commit points onward. |
| LoseTrack follows through a door the player just used (FrontRoomsMapHunter.cs:304-312) | Pressure costs prefer a door followed by a bend (the +2 sight-line cost), so the player is out of its line when it arrives. |
| Broken doors stay open for good (FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:1146-1156) | BREACH variant. Pressure routes skip it; calm routes may still pass through it. Over a run the ink becomes a map of dead doors, which matters more as run tiers shorten break time. |
| Unbroken glass blocks its path (its search skips Glass, FrontRoomsMapHunter.cs:511) and its sight | Calm routes may use windows (+4 cost). Pressure routes never do: the 1 s hold costs 4.2 m, and broken glass lets it follow. |
| Sprint: 5.5 m/s against a chase of 4.2 m/s (about 5.4 at run tier 5), 5 s of stamina, heard at 26 × 1.4 = 36 m at run tier 1 and about 58 m at tier 5 (FrontRooms3DGame.cs:153-155, 893) | The 8 m/s wave front stays ahead of a sprinting player, but at most about 12.5 m ahead (§4). EAR (P2) turns a sprint into a visible confession. |
| Door noise on any open or shut: 14 × 1.4 = 19.6 m at run tier 1, about 31 m at tier 5 (FrontRooms3DGame.cs:814-819) | It can trigger EAR at the door (P2). |
| Dead ends | STOP marks branch mouths; catches inside branches are a key metric. |
| Leash and relay (FrontRoomsMapHunter.cs:191-199, 396-425) | Relays raise `Arrived(Vector3, string)` (:153, :465). That ends an EAR hold, rebuilds the pressure field and restarts the trail samples (R6). The pursuit redesign would replace the leash teleport with a handoff (RELAY_PURSUIT_REDESIGN.md §8.2), and `Arrived` stays the signal. The OMEN wave is withdrawn (Rev 3; §14). |
| Keys glow yellow already (FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:1972, 2069) | With `doorsNeedKeys` off, a key is just another calm target. With it on, the key comes first. |
| The HUD shows Relay state text (CHASE and BREAKING DOOR included) and distance only with the Relay Readout assist, which is off by default (FrontRooms3DGame.cs:1594-1600, 1619) | Done per R14 (2026-10-03); Red answered Q1 in full. Without that change the ink would add no tension. |
| **Staged warning** (Red, 2026-10-03; proposed, owned by 系统设计: Documentation/RELAY_PURSUIT_REDESIGN.md §7). Distances are walking distance, Relay to player. Stage 1, within about 30 m: the **player's** room lamps flicker through `LampFx.Warn`.
- **Burst (RELAY v2, Rev 4):** 2–3 dips to 0.55–0.70 × base, with envelope attack 0.10 s, hold 0.06–0.15 s and release 0.22 s, spaced 0.55 s apart.
- **Quiet gap:** then 3–6.5 s of quiet, or 2.5–4 s at stage 2.
- During a burst the room set's lamps are held at `SetLampMode(Steady)`, so ambient stutter doesn't show through.
- Under `ReduceFlashing` the burst becomes a single slow dim to 0.6. Stage 2: muffled footsteps. Stage 3, on sight: a clear but non-jarring lock-on cue, then Chase. **Nothing dims around the Relay.** | **No halo and no radar.** The ink never marks the Relay's cell or its approach; Rev 2's Relay-centred lamp ideas are dropped. **Stage 1 is an intended beat: "when the lights flicker around you, the walls point."** The paper beside the player may gasp **GROUND only**. It is local to the player, so it is not a position readout, and it never strobes. The stage-1 flicker stops at stage 3, and the chase wave takes over on CHASE (§4). Stage 2 adds nothing to the ink. |
| Stage-1 gasp: how it works (Rev 3, proposed, SP) | **Why it needs its own gate (Rev 4, re-simulated for the v2 burst).** R1's Ls low-pass (τ 0.35 s) swallows the v2 burst entirely. Over 2–3 dips at 0.55–0.70× with holds of 0.06–0.15 s, the minimum Ls stays between 0.68 and 0.84, so the plain gate (Ls < 0.55) never opens. The burst gate is the only path to a gasp. **Detecting a burst.** A cell is in a Warn burst when its own lamp is lit (`LampBaseLevel` ≥ 0.55), `LampLevel` is below it, and the ink has put no Dip or Sag of its own on that cell. Warn is the only other override kind, so no new interface member is needed. **The gasp (retuned in Rev 4).** For such cells the gate reads the burst's deepest raw level d (a multiple of base) through one smooth envelope per burst (rise 0.3 s, fall 1.0 s, SP), so each burst gives a single breath at ≤ 0.5 Hz.
- Its strength is `smoothstep(0.72, 0.52, d)` × charge × the GROUND cap (G ≤ 0.25).
- So a 0.70× burst gives a barely visible breath (G ≈ 0.02), a 0.62× burst a soft one (≈ 0.14), and a 0.55× burst the full G ≈ 0.24 on a full-charge cell.
- It always stays below Beacon.
- During a burst the lamps are held Steady, so ambient stutter adds nothing. **GROUND only.** These cells pack GROUND and keep their committed message for later. Cells already dark from their own temperament keep showing their message as before. **Reduce Flashing.** The single dim to 0.6 never passes the gate, so there is no gasp. |
| Tall halls have no speed term | The ink never treats tall halls as safe. |

## 8. Interaction with the moving visible print

1. **Opposite masking phases.**
   - The visible print changes in the dark: it slips inside its own cell's lamp-dark window (10_synthesis.md:139-142), because ink colour vanishes when unlit.
   - Phosphor messages change in the light (R10b), because the glow is swamped there.
   - A failing lamp gives both systems a legal window every couple of seconds, in opposite phases. A dead cell has no lit phase, so its message changes only when unseen.
2. **Message vs substance** (R11). The shape is procedural and constant across print keyframes, so jumps and crawls never move a message.
   - The substance is one `_FR_InkSubstance` layer per run tier (spec v1.2: 768×1152 BC4, the EGRESS roll stamp), sampled with the warped print UV. It changes when the run tier rises (`_FR_InkTier`, set on `TierChanged`), never per print slice. EGRESS uses the tier step: the stamp goes from `SHEET A-3` to `A-4` to `A-1114 OF 4`, and then reads `OCCUPANTS 2` (§6).
   - The type layers (`_FR_InkType`) use their own world-fixed, unmirrored frame (R11). They never move with the print, and the message never moves either. Only the layer-9 scratch is max-composited over the moving substance, on GROUND cells from T3.
   - `_FR_InkTier` is a global, so the switch can happen while a glowing wall is in view. It is fine detail, read under 2 m. How it transitions is the visual chat's call.
   - Message cells take no lamp-dropout strip slips, so the paper never slides under a readable mark.
3. **Discrete jumps** (the default) use the same unseen set as message commits: one visibility service serves both.
4. **Slow crawl** at scripted beats only uses cells showing GROUND. Moving ink never carries a message.
5. **Chase wave.** One time-ordered front at 8 m/s carries three things in lockstep: the visible reprint, the lamp dip and the pressure commit.
   - The 192 m rebase caveat (10_synthesis.md:144) does not apply, because the ink is off in the stream rooms.
6. **Relay wake: REMOVED (Rev 4, RELAY v2 §9.2).** There is no wake reprint and no reprint at stage 0. The +2 pressure cost on wake cells is dropped too. The split is now two-way: the lamps (staged warning) say how close it is to you, and the ink says where to go.
7. **Subliminal drift** (≤ 1-2 mm/s, ±0.3% scale) moves the substance too, because it is sampled with the warped print UV. That is imperceptible and fine. The shape mask and the type frame are world-fixed.
8. **Per-roll phase** `strip & 3` (10_synthesis.md:80, 193): every FLOW wall looks the same in every on-route cell. The deliberate beat is that this cell points, not that it looks unique.

## 9. Readability and accessibility

**Shapes** (procedural, world space, in a glow band 0.8-2.0 m above the floor; player eye 1.62 m, LEVEL_MODULE_SPEC.md:133):

| Shape | Geometry (SP) |
|---|---|
| FLOW | Open chevrons 400 mm tall, stroke ≥ 100 mm, pitch 375 mm (8 per 3 m wall) |
| FLOW, pressure | The same chevron, doubled: 2 × 100 mm strokes with a 60 mm gap |
| HERE | 100 × 900 mm vertical bars on the ~1 m of wall beside a door, ~0.8 m beside a window (LEVEL_MODULE_SPEC.md:48-49) |
| BREACH | HERE plus a 100 mm diagonal bar |
| STOP | 2 horizontal bars, 600 × 120 mm, per 0.75 m roll |
| GROUND | The substance alone (`_FR_InkSubstance` at the current run tier) at weight 0.35. From T3 (run tier 4), about 1 GROUND cell in 8 also carries the layer-9 scratch cluster on one 0.75 m tile per face, max-composited (R11). |

- **Direction** comes from the world axis (z when |n.x| > 0.5, else x), never the mirrored PlanarFrame u (FrontRoomsSurface.shader:157-161). Arrows therefore point the same world way from both sides of a corridor.
- **Type frame (spec v1.2).** The type uses its own unmirrored u, `dot(posWS, normalize(cross(N, up))) / 0.75`. That is the opposite sign of PlanarFrame's `cross(up, n)` at :159, so text reads left to right on both faces. Arrow direction stays with `FaceSign`.
- **Layout (README v1.2).**
  - Horizontal type runs in rows at a 37.5 mm pitch, brick-offset.
  - The vertical-bar layers (2, 3, 5, 7) are baked rotated 90° clockwise, so they read top to bottom.
  - STOP pairs `NO`/`EXIT` sit on a 62.5 mm period, so any 120 mm bar holds a whole pair.
- **Stroke-fill rule:** inside strokes, type layers 0–8 keep a mean ≥ 0.6 in any 100 mm square (1.0 is the solid field, 0.55 is knocked-out type). The substance runs field 0.7, marks 0.4. That way strokes read as solid at 20 m. Fine detail is for reading under 2 m. Print B plays no part (reserved = 0).
- **Print chevrons vs ink chevrons (updated 2026-10-03, after Red chose the WP03 "Hard edge" print and dropped the ghost emboss).** Three cues keep them apart:
  - **Orientation:** the print's chevrons point UP the wall (55° mitred bands, plus the motif arrows), while FLOW chevrons point ALONG the wall toward the route.
  - **Medium:** the print is albedo seen in light; the ink is emission seen only in the dark.
  - **Arm angle:** the narrative chat (30_narrative_phosphor.md §5, "WP03 and the glyphs") asks for FLOW arms of about 30–35°, kept isolated inside the glow band, so that in failing cells, where both show, no ink chevron is ever drawn at the print's 55°.

  The final angle is the visual chat's call. EGRESS gives the difference a reason: the mill drew egress chevrons wider and blunter than the décor, because guidance must never be mistaken for decoration (30_narrative_phosphor.md §A.2, §5).

**Distances** (vertical FOV 76°, FrontRooms3DGame.cs:247, gives ≈ 691/d px per metre at 1080p):
- A 0.40 m chevron is ~14 px at 20 m, with strokes ~3.5 px.
- Side walls read only within 6-8 m, because foreshortening at 20 m down a 3 m corridor is ~0.075. **The decision read is the end wall at a T-junction or turn**; side walls confirm it up close.
- Fog is ExponentialSquared at 0.014 (`FogDensity` FrontRoomsLook.cs:21; mode :48; applied :50), so ~92.5% of the glow survives at 20 m.

**Luminance, not hue.**
- Glyph-to-paper ratio ≥ 1.3 in a full-charge dead cell with 2 lit neighbours; ≥ 1.15 in a failing cell at Ls 0.3 (SP).
- Emission is capped at ~12% of a lit wall's luminance, so the ink stays faint.
- Colour is about 530 nm (ZnS:Cu). Meaning is carried by shape and luminance, so it is safe for protan and deutan players.
- Screen budget: green covers ≤ 3% of pixels on average and ≤ 8% at p95, so Level 0 stays yellow.

**Photosensitivity.**
- Gate: R15, plus the P2 gate (≤ 3 flashes/s; no reversal above 3 Hz over > 25% of the screen), measured with glow, print, sags, waves, fixtures and the stage-1 warning bursts combined (10_synthesis.md:228).
- The existing stutter mode (FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:1389-1397) can exceed 3 Hz in bursts on its own. Audit it regardless of the ink.

**Settings:**

| Setting | Effect |
|---|---|
| Reduce wall motion (required, 10_synthesis.md:197-200). Rev 3: this is the one shared `FrontRoomsSettings.ReduceFlashing`, which is new and not in the code. The Relay warning and the print read the same setting (RELAY_PURSUIT_REDESIGN.md §7.4). | **In the lamp layer** (§11.1 Step 1): every attack and release is ≥ 0.5 s, and the chase wave becomes a static sag (no travelling wave; a static 4 s sag of radius 4 cells at Chase start). **In the ink:** Ls τ 1.0 s. Failing cells show a 3 s running mean (a steady, faint read). No crawl. The first-dark beat becomes a single 1.5 s fade. No EAR ramp shorter than 1.5 s. **Stage 1:** a warning burst becomes a single slow dim to 0.6, so there is no stage-1 gasp (§7). |
| Ink assist | Intensity ×1.5, GROUND off, strokes +30% |
| Relay readout (landed 2026-10-03; off by default) | One assist toggle (Esc → O → T) shows all Relay state text, CHASE and BREAKING DOOR included, and the distance. Nothing shows without it (Red, Q1 answered). Rev 1's three-way Off / State / State + distance is dropped under Red's one-toggle decision (R14). |
| Deaf and hard-of-hearing | EAR and the wave are visual first; sound only reinforces them. Stage 2 of the staged warning (footsteps) is sound only, and its visual cover is the 系统设计 chat's call. |

The ink is never the only signal: doors and windows stay visible as geometry.

## 10. Failure modes and exploits

### 10.1 Judge findings on the base design and how they are resolved

| # | Finding (lens) | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Too reliably helpful; reads as UI, not dread (play) | **Fixed in part.** Calm ink ignores the Relay (it can lure you into it). Following it speeds escalation. Hints are on-route only and about 2× random, not a GPS. Starved cells go blank. Physical lies from T4 (run tier 5). HUD distance retired. The residual risk is accepted and measured with the "help, lure or noise" survey. |
| 2 | The HUD distance undercuts tension; calm-to-pressure leaks the Relay (play) | **Fixed:** R14 (all Relay state text and the distance sit behind one assist, off by default; landed 2026-10-03, Q1 answered); R6 pressure is Chase-only (Red, Q3). Rev 3: the staged warning tells the player it is near without the ink, and the ink adds no halo or radar (§7). |
| 3 | The wave may push chase escape too high (play) | **Fixed:** wave cooldown 90-240 s and reach 10→6 cells by run tier; the wave dims the player's view of the Relay; run tiers shorten door breaks (2.5 s → about 1.3 s). Cap metric: escape ≤ 80% at T0, ≤ 60% at T3+ (run tiers 1 and 4+). |
| 4 | Heavy tuning; the invisible mode switch makes one chevron mean two things (play) | **Fixed:** the pressure variant is drawn doubled; pressure commits only at the wave front or unseen. Build order in slices (§11.4). |
| 5 | Office blind zones and dark clusters read as bugs (play) | **Fixed:** the fresh/starved physics (R2) makes blank dark a rule, and narrative explains it. Office stays blind and is accepted as deliberate (+1 route cost; measured). |
| 6 | Largest map-chat surface; LampDip affects lighting and sound (feasibility) | **Accepted and sliced.** Rev 2: one shared lamp-override layer (§11.1 Step 1), folded into `f.level` in both tick paths. Rev 3: interface v1 is agreed, and the map chat builds it once for the ink and the Relay warning. The hum follows `light.intensity` (FrontRoomsSoundDirector.cs:334) as a volume dip for free. |
| 7 | `zonesVisited` is private; new events needed (feasibility) | **Accepted:** a read-only `IReadOnlyCollection` plus a static `ZoneEntered` on FrontRooms3DGame, owned by the map chat (LEVEL_MODULE_SPEC.md:181 gives it FrontRooms3DGame.cs). |
| 8 | Dijkstra over `PassageBetween` may exceed 0.4 ms (feasibility) | **Fixed:** cached per-chunk adjacency bytes and flat 4096 arrays with a bucket queue (about 13 buckets); every edge read behind `IsBuilt`; rebuilds deferred out of chunk-build frames and time-sliced if over 0.5 ms. |
| 9 | Per-face shader logic plus 16 glyph slices (feasibility) | **Fixed:** procedural shapes and zero extra print slices. Rev 2: the close-up content is now two global arrays (Q2), fetched only inside the glow-mask branch. So glowing pixels pay up to two extra samples, and every wallpaper pixel pays one point load. |
| 10 | Depends on an unbuilt visibility service; hard to test (feasibility) | **Mitigated:** slices S1-S3 use a conservative frustum-only test (an occluded cell counts as seen, so the only risk is fewer commits). Commits through the lit path need no visibility at all. Debug overlay and 100-seed audits. Rev 2: WG2 is WebGL-only, so the ink needs its own desktop class (§11.1 Step 3). |
| 11 | R10 froze the ink against the moving print, weakening the sandwich (fit) | **Fixed:** R11. The substance is sampled with the warped print UV, so it moves with the print; the message stays fixed. Rev 2: the substance changes with the run tier, not per print slice. |
| 12 | Omniscient ink softens the dread (fit) | **Accepted as a narrative slot.** It knows the building, never the monster, and it lies late. Rev 3: EGRESS frames it as the building's own exit plan, "honest about the building and blind to whatever lives in it": a perfect evacuator with nowhere to send you (30_narrative_phosphor.md §A.1, §A.5). |
| 13 | Escalation coupling (fit) | **Accepted and measured:** minutes per tier with ink on vs off; tier counting by thresholds proposed. |
| 14 | Too many numbers for a presentation (fit) | **Accepted:** the deck uses one image (a mute lit corridor beside a dead troffer with chevrons) plus the 3.1 / 6.1 / 12.5 table. |
| 15 | Chevrons echo the removed relief (fit) | **Accepted as deliberate:** different proportions, emission only, and a narrative hook. |

### 10.2 Runtime failure modes

| Failure | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Beacon ping-pong (every dark cell points) | R7, on-route only (2.4 → 8.0 new zones / 100 cells) |
| GPS creep (continuous route dimming reached 14.7 vs a perfect 15.1) | Sags are snapshots; waves are chase-only with a cooldown; the on/off ratio is tracked |
| Visible message swaps | R10; dead cells commit only unseen; the ink never reuses the print's flicker-mask rule |
| Flow flip-flop | Hash tie-break on (cell & 63), 6-cell stickiness, ≤ 1 commit per 2 s |
| Glow beyond 16 m, or glow through the start door | Use the logical level (`LampLevel`); ignore the hold and fade (FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:1280-1284, 1309-1319) |
| Invisible same-height borders (~45%) tick ZONE without a threshold | The ink targets thresholds only; tier counting should follow (§15 Q2) |
| Lure into noise (calm route through glass, heard at 56 m at run tier 1, about 90 m at tier 5) | +4 window cost; otherwise the intended risk |
| False refuge (dark or tall = safe) | R13; the first contact in a glowing corridor shows it sees you |
| Edge of the world | Built-boundary cells are fallback targets; failed chunks (`failedChunks`, the catch in `Build`, FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:756-770) count as walls |
| Interior shift after 30 s away (`shiftAfterSeconds`, FrontRoomsLevelProfile.cs:31) | Targets do not change with revision; new routes commit ≥ 24 m away, unseen |
| Aliasing on stream, Office and start walls; jamb faces on cell lines | Ink-eligible mask (per-cell bit plus per-surface mask); clear texels on build and drop; jamb normal bias |
| EAR spam or noise sonar (tapping sprint to probe) | One bloom per 4 s. From T3 (run tier 4) the bloom is delayed 2-4 s if telemetry shows sprints under 0.5 s |
| Lure poisoning (players distrust all ink) | Lures only forge FLOW and only at T4+ (run tier 5); cut them if the true-FLOW follow rate after the first lure falls below 50% |
| Glyph clipping on 0.6 m columns or between trims | Accepted; or fade where a face is narrower than 0.75 m (visual's call) |
| Starved late game (high generation tiers darken the map) | Drought breaker and sags keep a floor |
| The stage-1 gasp reads as radar, or strobes (Rev 3) | GROUND only and never a message. It is local to the player's room and never at the Relay. It uses one smooth envelope per burst (§7), and there is none under Reduce Flashing. Measured by the comprehension survey (§13). |
| The stage-1 gasp never shows (Ls swallows the burst) | The burst gate (§7) reads the burst depth, not the low-passed Ls |

## 11. Implementation data flow

### 11.1 Pipeline

**Step 1: Lamp-override layer (map chat; interface v1 AGREED 2026-10-03).**

This replaces Rev 1's separate asks (`LampLevel`, `LampMode`, `LampDip`, `KillLamp`, `PromoteLamp`) with one shared layer.
- **Agreed by three chats:** the map chat (关卡设计), the wallpaper-print chat (this doc) and the Relay-pursuit chat (系统设计). The record is RELAY_PURSUIT_REDESIGN.md §7.4b.
- **Who builds it and when:** the map chat, in `FrontRoomsMapWorld`, after its current audit work.
- **Built (2026-10-03, by the map chat; in main, uncommitted):** the lamp-override layer v1 exactly as specified below.
  - `LampLevel` / `LampBaseLevel` return `NoLamp = −1` where no lamp is built.
  - `LampModeOf` is pure and never generates a chunk.
  - `SetLampMode` is persistent by cell: it survives chunk drop, rebuild and revisit shift. A live change starts a fresh lamp cycle, so a promoted lamp never fires on stale timers.
  - `SetLampOverride(cell, LampFx {Dip, Sag, Warn}, multiplier, hold, env?)` returns a handle; `RemoveLampOverride` is available, and overrides stack by MIN.
  - `FixtureChanged` fires at 0.15 / 0.55 / 0.8 with 0.02 hysteresis; `LampDipped` is also raised.
  - Under ReduceFlashing, attack and release are floored at 0.5 s.
  - Both tick paths are bit-identical when idle.
  - Step 2 (`FrontRoomsWayfinding`) waits until phosphor is scheduled.
- **Dropped:** the Relay-centred omen field (`SetLampField`), footfall dips, Herald and Restrike. They went after Red staged the warning (§7), and the Omen kind went with them.

| Member (v1) | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `LampLevel(cell)` / `LampBaseLevel(cell)` | **The logical level only**, from `f.level`, never `light.*` or the lens. `LampLevel` includes active overrides; `LampBaseLevel` is the level before them. Defined for built cells only, with a sentinel for unbuilt, start-area and Off cells. |
| `LampModeOf(cell)` | **Pure** (no side effects) and valid for unbuilt cells. It combines, in order: the seed hash (salt 211, :1178; first draw :1219), the odds of the chunk's generation tier (`tierRules.At(MapChunk.tier).LampMode(roll)`, :1221), the module override (`MapChunk.lamp`, :1223; Off at :1176), and any `SetLampMode`. See the rules below the table. |
| `SetLampMode(cell, mode)` | **Persistent.** It survives a chunk drop. It covers the kill (a new runtime Off mode) and the promote (e.g. Failing). See the rules below the table. |
| `SetLampOverride(cell, LampFx kind, multiplier, hold, Envelope? env = per-kind default)` returns a handle; `RemoveLampOverride(handle)` | **A timed dip on one lamp.** `LampFx` is `{ Dip, Sag, Warn }`: Dip for the first-dark dips and the chase wave, Sag for the power sag, Warn for the Relay warning's stage-1 bursts (系统设计). Attack and release come from a per-kind envelope table unless the caller passes `env`. Proposed defaults for this doc's calls (SP): Dip attack 0.3 s / release 1.2 s; Sag attack 0.6 s / release 1.5 s. Warn's are 0.08 s / 0.2 s (RELAY_PURSUIT_REDESIGN.md §7.1). There is no delay argument: callers schedule the call themselves, and the wave calls it as its front arrives. |
| Stacking | Effective level = **base × MIN of the active multipliers**, so overlapping overrides never multiply down to black. |
| Events | **`FixtureChanged(cell, level)`** on crossings of 0.15 / 0.55 / 0.8 only, never per frame. 0.55 and 0.15 are the ink gate's edges, and 0.8 is R10b's "invisible" line. **`LampDipped(cell, pos)`** when a dip starts, so the fixtures can buzz or tick (sound). The wayfinding class polls `LampLevel` every frame and needs neither; they are for sound and the Relay warning. |
| Tick | Folded into both tick paths: `TickFixtures` (desktop, :1268-1291, `f.level = Level(f)` at :1277) and `TickFixturesNear` (WebGL, :1293-1330, at :1308). **Bit-identical when idle** in both, so the WebGL fixture tests hold. See the rules below the table. |
| Reduce motion | Follows `FrontRoomsSettings.ReduceFlashing` (new; one setting shared with the warning and the print). When it is on, every attack and release is ≥ 0.5 s, and the chase wave becomes a static sag (§9). |

`SetLampMode` rules:
- It is stored in a world-level dictionary next to `brokenDoors` (:229). Drop and rebuild never clear it, so it survives chunk drops.
- It does not go in `MapChunk.lamp`, which `Cache.Shift` regenerates and the validator compares.
- It applies live to a built lamp, and in `BuildFixture` after the module line (:1223). The tier roll (:1219-1221) is still drawn, so later rng draws stay deterministic.
- **Live change.** Setting `f.mode` on a built fixture must also reset its `nextEvent` and `eventEnd` (:108-109). `Level()` reads them every frame, so otherwise a promoted lamp inherits the old mode's timers; a Steady lamp promoted to Dead, for example, keeps its build-time `nextEvent` (2–16 s, :1225). Once that has passed, the Dead branch (:1403-1410) fires at once and blinks to 0.8, instead of starting a fresh dead-blink cycle.
- **Precedence.** It wins over the tier roll and over an authored module lamp (Steady to Dim), because it applies after both. It does nothing in start-area cells.
- **Off module cells are out of reach.** A `ModuleLamp.Off` cell returns from `BuildFixture` before any fixture exists (:1176), so `SetLampMode` cannot revive or promote it unless that early return changes. The drought breaker only ever picks Steady cells, and Off cells are lampless anyway, so the ink does not need that change.
- **Answered (2026-10-03): yes, it survives a revisit shift** (kept by cell). This is what the ink wants:
  - A killed lamp (first-dark beat) and a promoted lamp (drought breaker) behave as permanent facts of the building, like `brokenDoors`.
  - Module-Off cells stay out of reach, as noted above.

`LampModeOf` rules:
- For a chunk the cache has not generated yet, it predicts at the current `GenerationTier`, with Auto lamps.
- It must never call `Cache.Get`. That would generate and cache the chunk early (FrontRoomsMap.cs:748-760).

Tick rules:
- Multiply right after `Level(f)`. Then the light intensity, the lens emission, the on-test and `CheckLampStatesForTools` (:1350) all stay consistent.
- The start-area hold stays outside `f.level` (:1280, :1309).
- WebGL's `FarEmissionStep` of 0.05 (:1265) lets a 0.3× dip through.

Prerequisites and notes:
- **A cell→Fixture index.** `Fixture` (:98-122) is private and stores no cell. Fixtures live only in each chunk's list (:152; added at :1226). Add a `GridCoord cell` field set in `BuildFixture` (:1173), plus a `Dictionary<GridCoord, Fixture>` cleared in `Unregister` (:728) and `RebuildChunk` (:319).
- **The kill mode must look the same live and after a rebuild:** a dark lens, not a missing troffer.
- **Rough size:** 120–200 lines, plus EditMode tests for persistence across Drop, Shift and RebuildChunk, the envelope, idle bit-identity and both tick paths.
- **Sound follows for free, as volume:** the hum reads `light.intensity` (FrontRoomsSoundDirector.cs:333-336; the read itself is at :334).

**Step 2: `FrontRoomsWayfinding` (map chat).** Proposed: a new plain-C# class in `Assets/Scripts/FrontRoomsMap/`, owned by FrontRoomsMapWorld.
- **Where it ticks:** in `Update`, right after `TickFixtures(Time.deltaTime)` (FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:663, before `TickDoors` at :664). It is primed once after `TickFixtures(0f)` in `Begin` (:405). Both tick paths keep `f.level` fresh for every built fixture, so it gets the same inputs on desktop and WebGL.
- **When it runs:** only in a real run, after `MapRunStarted`, or only when the world is not standalone. Otherwise the Level Designer's Play mode (`PlayHere` → standalone world, :346-350, 653-663) would show ink.

Each frame:
- (a) L, Ls, W, C, G per built cell. That is ≤ 1,600 cells at the default buildRadius 2 (3,136 at 3), about 0.05 ms with flat arrays.
- (b) Event-driven fields at ≤ 2 Hz:
  - the target field: a bucket Dijkstra. Step costs are 1–6 when calm and 0 to about 12 under pressure, so it needs about 13 buckets;
  - the Relay BFS (pressure only). It is the class's own, or it reads the hunter's chase-replan `depth` through a new read accessor (that dictionary is private);
  - leaf pruning for STOP.

  Every edge read goes through `IsBuilt` or the `MapChunk` edge arrays. `PassageBetween` calls `Cache.Edge`, which generates any chunk that is not yet in the cache (FrontRoomsMap.cs:750-761, 793-802).
- (c) Route descent and message assignment.
- (d) The commit gate (R10).
- (e) Sag, wave, first-dark, drought and EAR timers, plus the stage-1 burst gate (§7).
- (f) Packing the map's channels into the shared `Color32[4096]`. The map writes G, B and A; the visual driver writes R (Step 4).

**Step 3: Visibility (shared; owner open).** Proposed. The synthesis's version is a BFS over see-through edges from the camera cell, plus `TestPlanesAABB` (10_synthesis.md:135-138). It produces one set, used by both print jumps and ink commits.
- **What exists:** none of it is in the code. Only the inputs are: `CellOf` (:624), `PassageBetween` (:1121), `DoorBetween`/`Door.progress` (:1144, :134), `IsBuilt` (:633), `CellCenter` (:629) and `ZoneOf` (:636).
- **WG2 cannot supply it.** WG2 (VISUAL_CHAT_TASKS.md, row WG2, :87 at the time of writing; still running in a clone) builds `FrontRoomsVisibility` only under `(UNITY_WEBGL && !UNITY_EDITOR) || FRONTROOMS_WEBGL_PREVIEW` (10_webgl_plan.md:160 at the time of writing; 02_visibility_portals.md:346). Desktop and the Editor would get nothing.
- **The ink needs its own read-only class.** It must compile on every platform and touch no renderer or light. It could share WG2's 2D portal-walk algorithm. It needs:
  - a see-through predicate that counts a door as open at `Door.progress > 0`, not at the walking threshold of > .6 (:1135);
  - a start-area case: `PassageBetween` returns Wall there (:1126), and `startDoorCell` is private (:247);
  - for the exact walk, the planned `OpeningSpan` hook (`ArchOpening` is private, :1084).
- **Until then, use the frustum-only fallback.** It is conservative: about 355 cells marked seen against about 13 actually visible (02_visibility_portals.md:14). The only cost is fewer commits.
- **Red's call (§15 Q13):** sharing one set between desktop gameplay and WebGL rendering would break the rule that WebGL work never changes desktop or the Editor.

**Step 4: Pack and upload (visual chat driver).** Proposed; none of it exists yet.
- **The texture:** one 64×64 texture, created linear: `new Texture2D(64, 64, TextureFormat.RGBA32, false, linear: true)`. The project renders in Linear colour space, and an sRGB texture would decode G and corrupt the B bitfield.
- **Upload:** `SetPixelData` + `Apply(false)`, 16 KB per frame at worst. It is one upload, shared with the print's R channel: the map's G/B/A and the print's R go up together. A dirty flag skips frames where nothing changed on either side.
- **Reads:** the shader reads it with `LOAD_TEXTURE2D` and wraps with `& 63` itself, so point filter and Repeat wrap are harmless but unused. Bind a black texture at load.
- **Globals:** `_FR_CellState`, `_FR_Ink` (intensity, reduceMotion, assist) and `_FR_InkColor`, plus the Q2 ink globals: `_FR_InkType`, `_FR_InkSubstance`, `float4 _FR_InkTypeLayer[4]` (entries 0–9) and `_FR_InkTier`. `reduceMotion` mirrors `FrontRoomsSettings.ReduceFlashing`.

| Channel | Content | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| R | Print state (frame offset or transition) | Visual |
| G | Ink glow G (weight, EAR, forge already applied) × 255 | Map |
| B | Bits 0-1 direction N/E/S/W (on GROUND cells, bit 0 is the v1.2 scratch flag); bits 2-3 message GROUND/FLOW/HERE/STOP; bit 4 pressure; bit 5 BREACH; bit 6 forged on FLOW, window on HERE (v1.2); bit 7 ink-eligible | Map. For bit 7 the map writes the per-cell bit from `InStartArea` and `ZoneOf(cell).theme`; the shader masks per surface (doors, jambs, Office drywall). |
| A | Ls × 255 (from `LampLevel`, with a fixed default for lampless cells: Off and the start area), also the print's flicker mask | Map |

Where the B bits come from:
- BREACH (bit 5): a public `IsBrokenDoor(a, b)` backed by `brokenDoors` (:229), or the break-direction event.
- Pressure (bit 4): `StateChanged`.
- Forged (bit 6): set at run tier 5 (`TierChanged`).

**What spec v1.2 adds (Rev 3, proposed).** Spec v1.2 needs two per-cell facts the Rev 2 layout lacks: whether a HERE cell is a door or a window (layers 2 or 3), and whether a GROUND cell shows the scratch (layer 9). Both fit the 8 bits without a new channel:
- **HERE window: bit 6 on a HERE cell.** Only FLOW is ever forged, so bit 6 is free on HERE cells. A window is never BREACH or pressure, so the combination is unambiguous.
- **GROUND scratch: bit 0 on a GROUND cell.** GROUND has no direction, so bits 0–1 are free. The CPU sets bit 0 when the run tier is ≥ 4 and `Hash(seed, cell & 63, 977) < 0.125`. The shader has no seed, so the hash must run on the CPU. The shader then picks the one 0.75 m tile per face from a hash of the cell and face, and applies v ∈ [0, 1).
- **Layer lookup.** The shader turns the bits into a glyph id 0–9 and reads the layer from `_FR_InkTypeLayer`. The CPU rewrites the FLOW entry from layer 0 to layer 1 at T2 (run tier 3).

The final layout is agreed with the visual chat (Q2).

**Step 5: Shader (visual chat).** Proposed, for after the R2 print layer reaches main.
- **What exists today.** FrontRoomsSurface (Assets/Resources/Rendering/FrontRoomsSurface.shader) has no `_FR_PRINT` keyword and no print fetch. ForwardLit's only keywords are `_FR_MESH_UV` and `_EMISSION` (:96-97), and albedo is one `_BaseMap` sample (:185). R2 (`_FR_PRINT` + `_PrintTex`) is still in the visual chat's private copy (VISUAL_CHAT_TASKS.md, row R2, :102 at the time of writing).
- **Keyword and globals.** Add `#pragma shader_feature_local_fragment _FR_PRINT` to ForwardLit only, and declare the globals outside `UnityPerMaterial` (:52-71).
- **Where the ink is written.** Into `s.emission`, outside the `#if defined(_EMISSION)` block (:251-253), since the wallpaper materials do not use `_EMISSION`. `MixFog` (:256) then fogs it.
  - Use `nGeo` (:173), `input.positionWS` and `cavity` (:208).
  - The floor is at y = 0, so the height above the floor is `positionWS.y`.
- **Cost:**
  - one point load of `_FR_CellState`. This is a new texture instruction, unless it is shared with a per-cell load the print makes;
  - about 50–80 ALU: cell address and decode, FaceSign, InkShape with fwidth anti-aliasing, the 0.8–2.0 m band, the pressure doubling and the flag tests;
  - up to two array samples, on glowing pixels only. A message pixel takes type plus substance. A GROUND pixel takes substance only, plus layer 9 on a scratch tile.

  The GPU budget (≤ +0.2 ms) is plausible on desktop but must be measured. Q2's arrays add about 13.6 MB of GPU memory (spec v1.2).

```hlsl
int2  c     = (int2)floor((input.positionWS.xz + nGeo.xz * 0.5) / 3.0) & 63;

    float2 typeUV = float2(dot(input.positionWS, normalize(cross(nGeo, float3(0, 1, 0)))) / 0.75,   // v1.2: ONE unmirrored frame,

    half sub = SAMPLE_TEXTURE2D_ARRAY(_FR_InkSubstance, sampler_BaseMap, PrintUV(input.positionWS, nGeo), _FR_InkTier).r;  // warped print UV
    half content;
    if (msg == 0)                                               // GROUND: substance, plus the layer-9 scratch on its tile
        content = ScratchTile(code, c, nGeo, typeUV)            // B bit 0 (CPU: run tier >= 4, Hash(seed, cell & 63, 977) < 0.125), one hashed tile per face, v in [0,1)
                ? max(sub, SAMPLE_TEXTURE2D_ARRAY(_FR_InkType, sampler_BaseMap, typeUV, 9).r) : sub;
    else                                                        // layers 0-8 via _FR_InkTypeLayer[4] (entries 0-9)
        content = SAMPLE_TEXTURE2D_ARRAY(_FR_InkType, sampler_BaseMap, typeUV, InkTypeLayer(code)).r * sub;   // the combine is the visual chat's call
    s.emission += _FR_InkColor.rgb * glowMask * content * cavity;
}
```

The print's B channel is never read (it is reserved = 0). `PrintUV` is the P0 helper, with the Q1 warp.

- **Unset globals.** With the globals unset, `_FR_Ink.x` and `_FR_InkColor` read 0, so a fresh edit session and batch lookdev show no ink. Two catches:
  - An unset `_FR_CellState` is not a guaranteed zero. Unity binds a tiny default texture, and an out-of-range load is backend-dependent.
  - Globals set in Play stay set after Play exits.

  So the driver binds its own defaults: an `[ExecuteAlways]` driver, as in 10_synthesis.md:98, sets `Texture2D.blackTexture` and `Vector4.zero` in OnEnable, OnDisable and on `EditorApplication.playModeStateChanged`. And Step 2 runs only in a real run.
- The ink never writes albedo, normal, smoothness or cavity.

**Step 6: Events in.**
- **Existing:**
  - `DoorMoved`, `DoorBroken`, `GlassBroken` (`Action<Vector3>`) and `KeyTaken` (`Action<GridCoord>`) (FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:72-78);
  - `relay.StateChanged` (`Action<HunterState>`, FrontRoomsMapHunter.cs:149);
  - `ListenPoint` (`Vector3?`, :127; polled);
  - `Arrived(Vector3, string)` (:153, raised in `Appear` at :465). It ends an EAR hold, and it is a trigger for the pressure field and the trail samples (R6, §4).
- **From the agreed lamp layer** (Step 1; not built yet): `FixtureChanged(cell, level)` and `LampDipped(cell, pos)`. The ink polls `LampLevel` instead and needs neither.
- **From the pursuit redesign** (proposed, RELAY_PURSUIT_REDESIGN.md §7.4b): `WarnStage` (0–3) and `WarnStageChanged(int)`. The first-dark beat, the power sag and the drought breaker wait for stage 0 (§4).
- **The run tier:** `static FrontRooms3DGame.TierChanged(int)` (FrontRooms3DGame.cs:47). It fires 1 at run start (:636) and again on each rise (:1657). For comparison, the per-chunk generation tier is `MapChunk.tier` (FrontRoomsMap.cs:158), and the map's current one is `GenerationTier` (FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:50).
- **Exists but private:** the visited set (`FrontRooms3DGame.zonesVisited`, :168). It needs a read-only accessor, e.g. `IReadOnlyCollection<GridCoord> ZonesVisited`.
- **New:**
  - `ZoneEntered`: a static event on FrontRooms3DGame, raised at :903-906 next to the existing `Event("zone")` row, with the zone id and a "first visit" flag.
  - `ChunkBuilt`: raised where `built[coord] = chunk` runs (:884), never on the failed-build path.
    - "Built" is not "furnished". At `ChunkBuilt` the lamps exist (`BuildFixture` runs at :853), but the rooms are not dressed yet. `Furnish` (:1458-1466) queues them, and `DressNext` (:1469-1482) dresses one per frame from `Update` (:662).
    - The ink reads only cells, edges and lamps, so it ignores this. A consumer that needs the props, such as the WebGL plan's chunk-handle descriptor, needs a separate room-dressed hook.
  - `ChunkDropped`: raised in `Drop` (:719; `Unregister` at :722) and `RebuildChunk` (:319-331; `Unregister` at :325), not in the failed-build cleanup (:765). For teardown, use `MapRunEnded` (raised at FrontRooms3DGame.cs:1663).
  - The break-direction event the map chat is adding beside `DoorBroken`.

**How a listener reaches the run.** Through the static `FrontRooms3DGame.MapRunStarted(FrontRoomsMapWorld, FrontRoomsMapHunter)`, declared at FrontRooms3DGame.cs:39 and fired at :634 in `StartRunInPlace`. It fires before `map.GenerationTier = tier` (:635) and before `TierChanged` (:636). So take the tier from `TierChanged`, not from the map inside the handler.

**Events out:** `LampDipped(cell, pos)` (raised by the agreed override layer for the ink's own dips, as for any other), `WaveStarted(origin)`, `EarBloom(pos)`, `InkLegible(cell)` for telemetry, and `Event("ink", …)` rows.
- The telemetry sink `Event(string, string)` is private (FrontRooms3DGame.cs:1659). So the game subscribes to the ink's events in its run-start wiring (around :617-634) and forwards them as rows.
- Rows reach disk only in `End()` (:1671), so only runs that end in a catch save them.

**Budget (SP; desktop, buildRadius 2 = 1,600 cells):**
- **CPU:** ≤ 0.4 ms on average and ≤ 1.0 ms on rebuild frames.
  - This needs the cached per-chunk adjacency. A Dijkstra straight over `PassageBetween` would make about 6,400 dictionary-backed calls per rebuild.
  - It excludes the Step 3 visibility test. A per-cell `TestPlanesAABB` fallback costs 0.2–0.5 ms on its own unless it is culled per chunk first.
  - It stacks on the print driver's ~0.1–0.3 ms (10_synthesis.md:133).
  - It roughly doubles at buildRadius 3.
  - WebGL needs its own budget line, at about 4–5× (10_webgl_plan.md:120, "×4–5 in WebGL, ESTIMATE", at the time of writing).
- **GPU:** ≤ +0.2 ms (to be measured; Step 5).
- **Upload:** 16 KB per frame at worst, in one upload shared with the print's R channel (Step 4).
- **Memory:** about 32 KB for the texture (the GPU copy plus its readable CPU copy), plus roughly 100–200 KB of CPU-side state (staging, Ls, C, timers, fields, adjacency). Not 16 KB. The Q2 content arrays add about 13.6 MB of GPU memory (type ≈ 10.7 MB, substance ≈ 2.9 MB; spec v1.2). WebGL takes the reduced substance-only set.
- **Perf gate** (10_synthesis.md:230):
  - The 58.7 fps / p99 19.4 ms baseline is a single pre-P4 editor autopilot run of seed 2554 only (Verification/main-autopilot/report.json, M3 Max). Its fps is counted over the whole autopilot clock and capped at 60.
  - The gate's test set is not built: seeds 2554 and 20388 plus a Level 0 corridor flythrough, with FrameTimingManager GPU time. No flythrough harness and no GPU timing exist yet.
  - Re-run the baseline on the P4 code for both seeds, with the run tier pinned or logged (`tierLog`), before using the −1 fps / +1.5 ms p99 budget.
  - The project's own acceptance bar is avg ≥ 55 fps and p99 ≤ 33 ms (LEVEL_MODULE_SPEC.md:147). It uses the same two seeds, with its own baseline: 59 fps and p99 about 18 ms, measured with only `Kit_CRTMonitor`. The 58.7 / 19.4 figures belong to the wallpaper synthesis only.

### 11.2 Owner asks

| Owner | Must build |
|---|---|
| **Map chat (关卡设计)** | **Lamps:** the lamp-override layer of §11.1 Step 1. Interface v1 was agreed on 2026-10-03 with the wallpaper-print and Relay-pursuit chats, and it is built after the map chat's current audit work. It includes the cell→fixture index, the persistent modes (with the timer reset on a live change), the per-kind envelopes (Dip, Sag, Warn), `FixtureChanged`/`LampDipped`, `ReduceFlashing`, and both tick paths, bit-identical when idle. The same layer serves the Relay warning's `LampFx.Warn`, which the map chat also builds (RELAY_PURSUIT_REDESIGN.md §12). **Wayfinding:** `FrontRoomsWayfinding` (fields, pruning, route, messages, commit gate, timers, EAR, BREACH, forged FLOW, packing of G/B/A). **Events:** expose `zonesVisited` and `ZoneEntered`. Raise `ChunkBuilt`/`ChunkDropped` from `Build` (:756-770; `built[coord] = chunk` at :884) and from `Drop`/`RebuildChunk` (:719-725, :319-331); `Stream` is at :688-717. Add the break-direction event beside `DoorBroken`, and a read accessor for broken doors by edge. Treat `Arrived` as a pressure-field trigger. **Freeze on Caught.** **Debug overlay** (route, messages, branches): a live-run mode in `FrontRoomsMapDebugWindow`, which today draws only a preview cache. **Tests:** extend the existing chunk determinism check (FrontRoomsMapValidator.cs:204-215) to the wayfinding data. Add a 100-seed route truth audit; the harness (FrontRoomsMapVerification) checks structure only, so the wayfinding must compute from `FrontRoomsMapCache` data to run headless. Add a test for 0 commits while seen (new; needs the commit gate and visibility). Add an ink-follower autopilot policy in FrontRooms3DGame.cs (`AutopilotPlan` :1953, `AutopilotSteer` :1895, editor-only), not in FrontRoomsMainScenePlaytest. Switch it with a SessionState key or command-line argument from that launcher, and add new report fields. Seed the planner, which today picks goals with unseeded `UnityEngine.Random` (:1982). **Docs:** fix LEVEL_MODULE_SPEC §4 now. It omits the tiered temperament odds, and :76 still calls flicker odds the visual chat's numbers; LEVEL_DESIGNER.md:81 still lists tiers as "to come". Document the lamp layer, events and wayfinding once they are built, including that a lamp's mode depends on its chunk's generation tier and that overrides apply in both tick paths. MAP_GENERATION already covers P4. **Placard** (if Red says yes to Q10): placement on the map side of the start door. **Done since Rev 1:** the tier index (`TierChanged`, `GenerationTier`, `MapChunk.tier`) and the HUD change (R14; Q1 fully answered, no further change). |
| **Visual chat (游戏视觉)** | **Print layer:** promote the P0 print layer (R2) to main. Its `ApplyPrint` in FrontRoomsRenderSetup already keeps `_FR_PRINT` and its values through RenderSetup regeneration (10_synthesis.md:97), in the private copy. **Upload:** the state upload driver (Step 4). **Shader:** emission with `InkShape`/`FaceSign`, the height band, the cavity mask and the per-surface ink-eligible mask (stream, Office, start; the map writes the per-cell bit). Sample `_FR_InkType` and `_FR_InkSubstance` inside the glow-mask branch (Q2, spec v1.2; VISUAL_CHAT_TASKS.md, row Q2, :128 at the time of writing): one unmirrored type frame, layers 0–9 with the layer-9 scratch rule, and the 768×1152 substance. That is about 13.6 MB, with a reduced substance-only set on WebGL. Draw the glyphs for FLOW, HERE, STOP, BREACH, the doubled pressure variant and forged FLOW. No print-B work: print B stays reserved = 0. **Placard prop** with an InkShape legend, if Red says yes to Q10. **Look of the Warn burst** (RELAY_PURSUIT_REDESIGN.md §12). **Look:** ink colour and contrast against the targets. Lookdev captures at 1/6/12/20 m head-on and 6 m grazing, plus tall-hall spill. The combined flash audit. Reduce-motion and ink-assist paths. No strip slips on message cells. **Sign-offs:** lamp overrides (first-dark, drought breaker, optional border dusk), and the P4 per-tier lamp odds (FrontRoomsLevelProfile.cs:121-125, 164-171), which already changed the numbers LEVEL_MODULE_SPEC.md:76 calls the visual chat's. **Visibility:** not via WG2, which is WebGL-only (§11.1 Step 3). |
| **Wallpaper-print chat (this doc)** | **Ink arrays:** render `_FR_InkType` and `_FR_InkSubstance` from the EGRESS content (30_narrative_phosphor.md §A.11, saved as `Tools/print/ink/egress_v1.json`) to spec v1.2 (Tools/print/README.md, "Glow-ink textures (spec v1.2)"). The renderer is `Tools/print/ink_tool.py build`, which writes to `Tools/print/ink/out`. Its `ink_report.json` covers fit, seams, the stroke-fill rule (mean ≥ 0.6 per 100 mm inside strokes) and the stamps. The visual chat's Q2 waits on these verified textures. **Tier:** set `_FR_InkTier` on `TierChanged` from the wallpaper driver. **Done:** the lamp-override interface is agreed (§11.1 Step 1), and Red chose EGRESS. |
| **Sound chat (声音设计)** | **What follows for free:** lamp overrides change the hum's volume with no audio code. The hum reads `light.intensity` (FrontRoomsSoundDirector.cs:333-336; lamps registered by name at :256-259) and sends it as the FMOD `Level` parameter (:353). **No pitch dip to tune:** `Level` automates volume only (0 → −60 dB, .05 → −30 dB, 1 → 0 dB). A pitch curve on `Level` would also bend failing and stuttering lamps, so a sag-only pitch dip needs a separate parameter (for example a per-voice `Sag` value from the override layer), sent by FrontRoomsSoundDirector. **Limits:** only the 4 nearest lamps within 10 m have hum voices. A 0.3–0.35× dip never crosses the Tick/Strike thresholds (.15 / .6; `LampEvents`, :358-375), so sags, waves and warning bursts make no ballast click on their own. The agreed layer adds `LampDipped(cell, pos)` for each dip, and `FixtureChanged(cell, level)` on 0.15 / 0.55 / 0.8 crossings, so sound can buzz or tick with a dip. The Relay warning asks for exactly that (RELAY_PURSUIT_REDESIGN.md §7.1). The first-dark kill does cross .6 → .15 and fires the existing Tick; the ballast-death pop can replace or layer it. **New work:** a wave stinger aligned to `WaveStarted` (the Chase stinger already fires on `StateChanged`, :546). A ballast-death pop for the first-dark beat and the drought breaker. A quiet positional EAR cue, played only when a bloom cell is dark and in view. Never sound an unseen commit. The ink itself is silent; under AUDIO_CONTRACT.md the print never touches audio files. Update the hooks table. |
| **Narrative chat** | **Done:** EGRESS fills §12 (30_narrative_phosphor.md §4), and §A.11 freezes the ink content. **Open with Red** (its §7): the placard (Q10), the T4+ GROUND figure layer, the Caught line, and any string changes before render. |
| **Systems chat (系统设计)** | Owns the staged warning (Documentation/RELAY_PURSUIT_REDESIGN.md §7); the map chat builds it. Ink-side asks: nothing changes at the Relay's own position; stage-1 lamp changes stay ≤ 3/s (§7.4 there); the stage-1 flicker stops at stage 3; and the LD chase wave runs on CHASE only. **Correction to ask for:** RELAY §7.5 says a stage-1 burst drops the player's cell below the ink's 0.55 gate. That holds only for some dip holds (§7, Stage-1 gasp). The gasp comes from the ink's own burst gate, so §7.5 should say that; no interface change is needed. |

### 11.3 Testing hooks

- **`inkEnabled` editor toggle** for A/B testing. It is new, and trivial once the ink exists.
- **Tier pinning.**
  - The generation tier can already be pinned: `FrontRoomsMapCache.Tier` (FrontRoomsMap.cs:742), `Generate(coord, revision, tier)` (:558) and `GenerationTier` (FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:50). The interaction tests already use it.
  - The run tier cannot be pinned. FrontRooms3DGame's `tier` is private (:172), reset at run start (:613), and pushed to the map at :635 and in `RaiseTier` (:1651).
  - Add an editor-only pin read from SessionState (like `AutopilotSeedKey`), applied at :613, with `RaiseTier` skipped while it is pinned. That is about 10–20 lines.
- **`Verify 100 seeds`** (FrontRoomsMapVerification.cs:23-52) reports structure only: edges, zones, keys, pillars, modules, and a walls-only flood fill.
  - Beacon spacing needs `LampModeOf`, with the tier rules passed into the validator. Today the validator runs at generation tier 1 only.
  - Branch counts are a modest new leaf count.
  - Target reachability needs the wayfinding target field.

### 11.4 Build order (weekly slices)

| Slice | Content | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| S1 | Lamp-override layer v1, agreed (§11.1 Step 1: index, `LampLevel`/`LampBaseLevel`, `LampModeOf`, `SetLampOverride`/`RemoveLampOverride` with `LampFx { Dip, Sag, Warn }`, `SetLampMode`, `FixtureChanged`, `LampDipped`, `ReduceFlashing`, both tick paths bit-identical when idle; built after the map chat's audit work); `ChunkBuilt`/`ChunkDropped`; G gate on natural lamps (already tiered by generation tier); GROUND only; per-cell ink-eligible bit (`L0_Wallpaper` is shared with the stream rooms) | Map, about one slice. Visual: the `_FR_CellState` upload, the ink path in FrontRoomsSurface and keyword persistence. These are blocked until R2 P0, then Q1, then Q2 (spec v1.2) land; a constant substance can stand in before Q2. No visibility needed, because nothing commits yet. |
| S2 | Calm target field, route, FLOW/HERE, commit gate, debug overlay. Prerequisite: read-only `zonesVisited` and `ZoneEntered` | Map; frustum-only visibility |
| S3 | STOP via leaf pruning; truth audit | Map |
| S4 | First-dark beat (path-distance cell at BFS depth 2–4, after the start-door shut, at `WarnStage` 0) | Map, visual sign-off, sound pop. Rev 1 also listed the HUD change here; it has landed. |
| S5 | Chase wave (CHASE only, filtered trigger, time-ordered front), pressure variant (Relay trail sampled from `relay.Position`, restarted on `Arrived`), BREACH; the stage-1 burst gate (GROUND gasp) once the staged warning exists | Map: needs the S2–S3 commit gate; the dips come from S1. The gasp needs the pursuit redesign's `LampFx.Warn` and `WarnStage`. Visual: the pressure and BREACH glyphs; the shared reprint wave needs R2 in main. Sound: the `WaveStarted` cue. |
| S6 | Power sags, drought breaker, ink columns on the existing `FrontRoomsTier` rows (beacons, weight, sag interval, wave cooldown and reach, STOP depth, forge rate), read by run tier | Map |
| S7 | Desktop visibility class (new; WG2 is WebGL-only); EAR (P2) | Map (+ visual for the shared print/ink set), sound; needs Red's OK (§15 Q13) |
| S8 | Forged FLOW, on from T4 = run tier 5 (Red, §15 Q4); the forgery metrics act only as a kill switch | Map, visual lookdev |

The HUD and the tier backbone have landed, so the map work is now closer to 7 slices. The timeline depends more on the visual chain (R2 → Q1 → Q2) and on the visibility class than on the map chat.

## 12. Narrative slots

**Filled by EGRESS** (Red's choice, 2026-10-03). The pointers go to 30_narrative_phosphor.md §4, the section for EGRESS, "the building's own exit plan"; its slot table is §A.5. Each answer below is one line, and the narrative doc holds the full text. The fiction changes no mechanic.

| Slot | What the mechanic needs | EGRESS answer |
|---|---|---|
| What the underprint is and who printed it | Period-plausible ZnS:Cu (1990 era lock; strontium aluminate is too late). Only on wallpaper, never on Office drywall. | A 1990 contract-mill ZnS:Cu egress underprint under the WP03 print, sold as base-building life safety. Office drywall is tenant fit-out and is not on the plan (§A.2). |
| Why it knows the way to NEW thresholds and never leads back | Knowledge of the building's layout that survives interior shifts. Candidates: a previous wanderer's trail, the building's memory, a printing defect. | The building re-papers when it rearranges, so the plan is redrawn each time. A compartment you have left counts as evacuated, so it never sends you back (§A.2). |
| Why it needs light to charge, and why dark clusters are blank | A rule players can repeat, for example "the paper only remembers what it was shown". | The install rule: "no light in, no light out" (§A.2). |
| Why it reacts to the Relay's chase (wave, doors away from it) | Do the walls fear it, serve it or record it? It must **not** imply the Relay can't see in the dark. | A silent alarm from the zone of origin. The lamps drop to emergency level so the paper can be read ("the dark is for the paper, not for you"), and ALARM ROUTE points to doors you can shut (§A.2). |
| The staged warning, stage 1 (new in Rev 3) | Local only, GROUND only, never radar (§7). | Pre-alarm: the panel tests your compartment's emergency power, and the annunciator lights your zone (§A.10). |
| Help or herding | Following it speeds escalation; the fiction can frame it as both. | Both: a perfect evacuator with nowhere to send you (§A.5). |
| What the ink shows up close (under 2 m) | The content of `_FR_InkType` (layers 0–9 by message, variant, forged state and the scratch) and `_FR_InkSubstance` (one layer per run tier), to spec v1.2 (R11). The content changes with the run tier, not with print slices. Stroke-fill rule: mean ≥ 0.6 inside strokes. | US life-safety sign type (TeX Gyre Heros Bold) and roll stamps, frozen in §A.11. Human marks are the M9 scratch lines (layer 9) and the forger's hand. |
| The look and naming of FLOW, HERE, STOP, BREACH and the pressure variant | The families must stay go = open, threshold = frame, stop = closed. Any link to the old relief chevrons. | WAY ON, EXIT, NO EXIT, OUT OF SERVICE and ALARM ROUTE (§A.6). The chevrons are drawn wider and blunter than the décor's 55° bands, because guidance must never be mistaken for decoration (§A.2, §5). |
| What the power sags are | Building electrics, the Relay, or something else. | The emergency-lighting self-test, which runs far too often because time here is wrong (§A.2). |
| The first-dark beat | Flavour for the ballast pop, plus an optional one-line Flash if playtest needs it. | A ballast dies and the fresh-charged plan blooms. The fallback Flash is "WHERE THE LIGHT DIES, THE PAPER POINTS" (§A.2, §6). |
| EAR | Is the paper listening, or answering? | Answering. It works like a fire panel's annunciator, reporting a logged noise (§A.2). EAR itself is still open (§15 Q8). |
| Forged FLOW (on from T4) | Who forges it, and why a forgery cannot hide under light. Only "go" marks are forged. | The other occupant (`OCCUPANTS 2`). It is too bright to be paper, and up close the type is the hand-drawn `THIƧ WAY OUT` (§A.3). |
| Legend (§15 Q10) | An optional teaching object. | A framed evacuation-plan placard on the map side of the start door (§A.2). It is open with Red. |
| Optional anchor | The Gilman sub-pattern (10_synthesis.md:238-240). Real ZnS:Cu egress marking (FAA floor-path rules after 1983) as research with original photos and sources. | Gilman's sub-pattern, seen only in certain lights (§3.1, §A.2). The real-world parts (the pigment, chevron egress marking, NO EXIT, self-tests) are from the period (§A.2). |

## 13. Playtest plan and metrics

**Phases:**
1. **Lookdev stills:** direction call at 6/12/20 m head-on and 6 m grazing, with and without assist, plus a colour-blind filter pass.
2. **Automated audits:** 100 seeds and autopilot.
3. **Class playtest:** an A/B test with ink on and off on the same seeds, with the HUD Relay readout off in both arms (the default since 2026-10-03; no Relay state text at all).
4. **3-run sessions:** 3 runs per player for the teaching curve.

| Metric | Target (SP) | If missed |
|---|---|---|
| Hint strength: new thresholds per minute, ink on / off | 1.6-2.2× (sim: 2.0) | Above 2.5 it is a GPS: cut sags or T0 adjacency. Below 1.3: raise the weight or enable border dusk. |
| Follow rate: FLOW within 8 m in view ≥ 0.5 s, then the next 3 cells descend the field | 50-75% | Revisit the first-dark beat or the shapes |
| Teaching: first beacon in view → first follow | < 20 s for ≥ 70% of first-time players; ≥ 70% cross their first ink-led threshold within 60 s | Add the Flash line |
| Beacon spacing on routes actually walked | One readable beacon every 5-8 cells (sim 6.2); legible sightings every 20-40 s median | Drought breaker interval; border dusk |
| Chase escape rate, wave vs no wave | Rises, but ≤ 80% at T0 and ≤ 60% at T3+ (run tiers 1 and 4+) | Shorten wave reach; lengthen cooldown |
| Doors shut per chase | Rises with the wave | Pressure HERE readability |
| Catches inside leaf-pruned branches | ≥ 50% lower with ink on | STOP depth or weight |
| Office time per run; Office-heavy seeds | Track | +1 → +2 route cost |
| Minutes per tier, ink on vs off | ≤ 1.5× faster with ink | Tier counting by thresholds |
| Comprehension, after run 1 with no text: "what does the green mean?" | ≥ 70% say "way on / new area / door"; ≥ 50% name the dead end; < 15% say "dark hides me" | First-contact beat; fiction |
| Survey: help, lure or noise? | A mix of help and lure; noise < 25% | Weight, spacing |
| Forged FLOW (on from T4) | 30-50% followed on first exposure, < 20% by the third; true FLOW still followed ≥ 50% afterwards | Cut forgeries (the kill switch) |
| EAR (P2) | ≥ 60% leave the bloom cells within 8 s without sprinting by the second exposure | Cue clarity |
| Stage-1 gasp (Rev 3; once the staged warning exists) | Asked after a run: "what did the green do when your lights flickered?" < 15% say it shows where the Relay is. The flash audit passes with bursts on. | Weaken the gasp (a lower GROUND weight in bursts) or cut it |
| Truth audit (automated) | Every route ends at a valid target; 0 FLOW into branches; 0 pressure routes through windows or BREACH | Bug |
| Change-blindness audit | 0 commits while seen, except at sag, wave or EAR fronts; < 1 flip per cell per 2 s | Bug |
| Flash audit (normal and reduce-motion) | ≤ 3 flashes/s; no > 3 Hz reversal over > 25% of the screen, with stage-1 bursts included | Lengthen ramps; fix stutter |
| Green screen coverage | Mean ≤ 3%, p95 ≤ 8% | Raise thresholds |
| Perf | CPU ≤ 0.4 ms average, ≤ 1.0 ms on rebuilds; GPU ≤ +0.2 ms; within the synthesis gate, re-baselined on the P4 code (§11.1 Budget) | Time-slice the fields |

## 14. Alternatives considered

| Design | Play | Feasibility | Fit | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Afterglow Blazes (wayfinding), chosen** | 8 | 7 | 8 | **23** |
| Afterglow Wake (threat_intel) | 7 | 7.5 | 6 | 20.5 |
| Afterglow Ledger (light_economy) | 6 | 6 | 7 | 19 |
| Afterglow Grammar (anomaly_literacy) | 6.5 | 5 | 6.5 | 18 |

**Afterglow Wake (threat_intel), 20.5.** The ink as a ledger of the Relay: wakes that fade with age, knots where it listened, EAR blooms on accepted noise, permanent breaches, and an OMEN wave before each arrival, all read at the cost of standing in the dark.
- Strengths: the best dread, the cheapest core (it polls public hunter API), and the key catch that the HUD distance makes any intel ink pointless.
- Not chosen because: it adds nothing during a chase; its five mark kinds read at range only as "how much"; it fixes the fiction (the Relay writes the ink); and it deletes the synthesis's visible wake reprint.
- Grafted: HUD retirement, BREACH, EAR (P2), the silhouette beat.
- Rejected:
  - **OMEN:** it needs Arrive split into a delayed commit plus a new `HunterState.Arriving`, which touches release timing, sound and AUDIO_CONTRACT. Rev 1 and Rev 2 kept it as a possible P3. *Rev 3: withdrawn.* Red's staged warning puts every Relay tell around the player and nothing at the Relay's position. The Relay-centred lamp ideas (omen field, Herald, Restrike) were dropped from the lamp interface for the same reason. The pursuit redesign's `Arrive` state is a hunter state, not an ink mark.
  - **The adaptation cost:** it taxes exactly the 20 m end-wall read that carries this design's decisions. Reading cost comes instead from scarcity and failing-lamp breathing.

**Afterglow Ledger (light_economy), 19.** Light as the price of a hint: hyperbolic charge physics, WAY and SHUT signs coded by which wallpaper roll glows, a pull-the-tube verb to buy darkness, a Relay that wanders toward dark, and lamps that only degrade with tier.
- Strengths: the truest phosphor physics, narrative freedom over glyph shape, and a strong first-dark reveal.
- Not chosen because: reads are scarce and fiddly (0.1-0.5 s gasps); there is little in a chase; and it needs a new verb (`BuildFixture` removes the lens collider, `Kill(panel.GetComponent<Collider>())` at FrontRoomsMapWorld.cs:1185), hunter weighting, noise multipliers and runtime changes to flicker odds the visual chat owns.
- Grafted: hyperbolic decay and the fresh/starved rule, constant physics across tiers, meaning in a world-space mask with the substance owned by narrative, the first-dark beat, the drought breaker.
- Pull-the-tube stays a stretch goal, used only if playtests show beacon drought.

**Afterglow Grammar (anomaly_literacy), 18.** An 8-word fixed language at branch mouths (THROUGH, BLIND, DOOR, DOOR·BLIND, GLASS, WAKE, HEART, LURE), learned across runs with no save data, with forgeries that glow under lit lamps.
- Strengths: the best fork semantics and the most elegant lie tell.
- Not chosen because:
  - fluency takes 6-10 runs, which student playtests cannot validate;
  - forced reader lamps make troffers the real tell;
  - its "every chunk is a spanning tree" premise is false (non-tree edges are Open or Arch at 18-70%, FrontRoomsMap.cs:94-96), so its dead-end words could lie;
  - tier-dependent planning breaks determinism, and it consumes the whole 32-slice print sheet.
- Grafted: silhouette families, the physical lie tell (T4+, forging FLOW only), and no strip slips under messages.
- DOOR·BLIND ("a door into a closed pocket", a refuge from a wanderer) is held as an optional POCKET variant (§15).

## 15. Open questions for Red

**Rev 3 status.**
- **Answered:** Q1 (in full), Q3 and Q4, plus the narrative direction (EGRESS) and the staged Relay warning. These are recorded below and in the Rev 3 note.
- **Still open:** Q8 (EAR), Q10 (the placard) and Q11 (escalation coupling), which are the ones the narrative chat also waits on (30_narrative_phosphor.md:29), and Q2, Q5, Q6, Q7, Q9, Q12 and Q13.

1. **HUD. ANSWERED in full and landed (Red, 2026-10-03).**
   - **All** Relay state text, CHASE and BREAKING DOOR included, and the distance readout are hidden by default. Only ONE assist toggle, RELAY READOUT, shows them (Esc → O → T; FrontRooms3DGame.cs:91-94, 333, 1564, 1594-1600, 1619). The map chat has landed it, and nothing else changes.
   - Original question: may the map chat retire `RELAY nn M` and the HUNT/SEARCH state text and move them behind an assist?
2. **Tier counting:** count by new thresholds (6 per tier or 2.5 min), or keep the code's zone ids (4 new zones per tier or a 120 s stall, landed in P4)? Zone ids tick about 3.6 per minute even for a random walker. Rev 3: the pursuit redesign asks a related question, its Q3: count 150 new cells per tier and remove the stall rise. Decide the two together (§6).
3. **ANSWERED (Red, 2026-10-03): pressure fires on CHASE only.** The chase wave and the pressure re-pointing both start on CHASE and nothing else (R6, §4). Original question: **Pressure trigger:** Chase only (recommended), or also Hunt and Search within 8 cells (stronger, but it leaks the Relay)?
4. **ANSWERED (Red, 2026-10-03): forged FLOW is ON from T4** (= run tier 5). Original question: **Lies:** enable forged FLOW at T4+, or keep the ink truthful forever?
5. **Office blind zones (13.6% of cells):** keep them as deliberate hint-free stretches? EGRESS gives them a reason: tenant fit-out, not on the plan.
6. **First-dark beat:** use the in-view lamp death (recommended) or the original pre-dead cell? Either one needs visual-chat sign-off on the lamp override. Rev 2 picked the cell by path distance. Rev 3 corrects it to BFS depth 2–4 from `startDoorCell` and makes it wait for `WarnStage` 0 (§4).
7. **Lamp overrides:** may the drought breaker and the optional border dusk change lamp temperaments (LEVEL_MODULE_SPEC.md:76)? P4 already moved the base odds into the tier table, with no recorded sign-off. The lamp interface itself is agreed (§11.1 Step 1); this asks only whether these two uses are allowed.
8. **EAR:** in the core at S7, or cut? (The narrative chat lists it as open too.) Rev 3: the OMEN arrival wave is no longer asked. It is withdrawn under Red's staged warning, since nothing marks the Relay's position (§14).
9. **POCKET variant** (DOOR·BLIND hide-hole) as a calm secondary message: worth the extra shape?
10. **Placard (was: legend room).** EGRESS replaces Rev 1's legend stream room with a framed evacuation-plan placard on the map side of the start door. It shows `YOU ARE HERE`, a start room and `SEE SHEET A-3`, and its glow legend lights only when its lamp is off (§5; 30_narrative_phosphor.md §A.2, §7 Q2). It is a prop outside the stream rooms, so it needs no exception to the stream-room mask. If yes: the visual chat builds the prop, and the map chat places it. Yes or no?
11. **Escalation coupling:** is it acceptable that following the ink makes a run escalate faster? The coupling holds under the code's zone count, the threshold count (Q2) and the pursuit redesign's 150-cell count.
12. **Deck framing:** use "the print shows where it walked; the ink shows where to go" as the one-line explanation of the sandwich? EGRESS offers its own deck line, "The wallpaper is a fire-exit plan for a building with no outside" (§A.1). With the staged warning the full split has three parts: lamps say how close, the print says where it walked, and the ink says where to go (§8).
13. **Visibility (new in Rev 2):** the ink's commit gate needs a desktop visibility class, because WG2 is WebGL-only. May it share one visible-cell set with WebGL rendering? Or must the two stay separate, under the rule that WebGL work never changes desktop or the Editor (§11.1 Step 3)?
