# Wallpaper print tools (the motion layer of the "sandwich" wallpaper)

Design and research: `Documentation/research/wallpaper_motion/10_synthesis.md`.

## Ownership

- **Wallpaper-print chat:** owns everything in this folder: the print content, the pack tool, the importer and the driver.
- **Visual chat (游戏视觉):** owns the paper layer and the `_FR_PRINT` path in `FrontRooms/Surface` (P0).

## Contract with the shader

| Global | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `_FR_Print` | Texture2DArray. One slice = one 0.75 × 1.125 m roll tile, 1024×1536, linear. R = ink density (0 ground, 0.5 mid, 1 deep), G = cream/accent, B = phosphor glow ink, A unused |
| `_FR_PrintClock` | x = frame position [0, n), y = n, z = per-roll phase (frames), w = live mix (0 shows the material's static `_PrintTex` frame 0) |
| `_FR_PrintWarp` | x = amplitude (m), y = phase (rad, [0, 2π), wrapped on the CPU), z = wavelength (m), w = enable. Divergence-free warp, periodic every 3 m. Exact HLSL is in the visual chat's `PrintUV` helper. |

The palette (ground, mid, deep, cream) lives in each material, never in the frames.

## Making a print

Use a Python with numpy and Pillow; on this Mac that is `/usr/bin/python3`.

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 Tools/print/print_tool.py gen-test Tools/print/frames/chevron_test
/usr/bin/python3 Tools/print/print_tool.py validate Tools/print/frames/chevron_test
/usr/bin/python3 Tools/print/print_tool.py pack Tools/print/frames/chevron_test Tools/print/out/FR_Print_ChevronTest.png
/usr/bin/python3 Tools/print/print_tool.py preview Tools/print/frames/chevron_test Tools/print/out/chevron_test_preview.png
```

**Authoring art in Figma or After Effects**
- Make a 750×1125 frame (1 px = 1 mm), with the motif in black on white.
- Duplicate any shape that crosses an edge onto the opposite side, so the tile repeats seamlessly.
- Export one PNG per keyframe (K00.png, K01.png, …) and pass `--art` to `validate`, `pack` and `preview`.

**What the commands do**
- `validate` fails any frame whose wrap seam differs from its interior neighbours by more than 1.5×.
- `pack` refuses to pack frames that fail `validate`.

**Keyframe order matters**: the order is the story. The driver blends only to the adjacent slice (K07 blends back to K00). Jumping to a non-adjacent slice is a hard cut, and it is only allowed while the change is masked (unseen, or during a lamp dropout).

## Game textures: encoded 2048² slices (Red, 2026-10-03)

This is the path the game uses. It supersedes the 1024×1536 sheet below.

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 Tools/print/print_tool.py build-print hard_edge --size 2048x2048
```

The command does the following:
1. Renders the vector pattern at 2048×2048, one 0.75 × 1.125 m roll tile, 4× supersampled.
2. Builds the 8 keyframes from the RAW density and cream values.
3. Encodes each slice through the visual chat's `Tools/lookdev/print_encode_lut.json`: a bilinear lookup over [density][cream], done at the slice's own resolution. The encoding is binding for P0 parity.
4. Writes `patterns/out/hard_edge/encoded/K00..K07.png`. These are linear RGBA, with R/G encoded, B = 0, A = 1, and no mips.

After that, the visual chat's editor menu "FrontRooms/Rendering/Build Print Array" takes over. It builds `Assets/Resources/Print/FR_Print_HardEdge.asset` with the custom `FrontRoomsPrintMips`, and writes slice 0 as `_PrintTex`. The output is BC5, or R8G8 if BC5 fails its T1a/T2 check.

`print_report.json` records the LUT sha1, a LUT node self-test (error 0), and per-slice means and seams. `raw/` holds the pre-encode frames.

## Chosen pattern: Hard edge (Red, 2026-10-03)

Red picked the precise vector redesign **Hard edge** (Figma section 2407:852, frame WP03 2407:884, master component 2407:2209). Its generator `patterns/hard_edge.py` writes both the SVG and `patterns/out/hard_edge/K00.png`, the static frame 0 the visual chat imports as `_PrintTex`.

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 Tools/print/print_tool.py gen-keys Tools/print/patterns/out/hard_edge/K00.png Tools/print/frames/hard_edge
/usr/bin/python3 Tools/print/print_tool.py pack Tools/print/frames/hard_edge Tools/print/out/FR_Print_HardEdge.png
```

- The 8 keyframes use the same operations as the test set below.
- Every frame passes the seam check.
- Slice 0 is byte-identical to `patterns/out/hard_edge/K00.png`.
- Preview: `out/hard_edge_preview.png`.
- The other directions (faithful_teeth, stepped_grid, hybrid) stay in `patterns/` for reference.

## Test content: `frames/chevron_test`

Eight keyframes built from today's chevron ink, with the same formula as `gen_surfaces.py`. Each step adds one more thing wrong with the paper:

| Frame | Change |
|---|---|
| K00 | original |
| K01 | mirrored |
| K02 | half-drop |
| K03 | double repeat |
| K04 | starved ink |
| K05 | flooded ink |
| K06 | negative |
| K07 | turned |

Every frame passes the seam check. The packed sheet is 4096×3072 (4 × 2 slices). Preview: `out/chevron_test_preview.png`.

## Unity scripts: `unity_staging/` (NOT in Assets yet)

- **`Assets/Scripts/Rendering/FrontRoomsPrintDriver.cs`** writes the three globals above.
  - **Motion:** a `HoldAndJump` module by default (45–90 s holds, 1.2 s smoothstep blends to the next keyframe), an always-on subliminal drift, and `Crawl` beats through `Play(...)`.
  - **Game API:** `JumpNext()`, `CutTo(slice)` (masked only), `Frozen` (Caught, pause) and the persisted `ReduceMotion` accessibility switch, which freezes everything.
  - **Startup:** it boots itself once `Resources/Print/FR_Print_HardEdge` exists, so no scene edit is needed. With no driver, the globals stay 0 and the walls show the static frame 0.
- **`Assets/Editor/Print/FrontRoomsPrintImporter.cs`** imports `Assets/Resources/Print/*.png` as a Texture2DArray.
  - It reads `columns`/`rows` from the matching `.print.json`.
  - Import settings: linear, mips, Repeat, trilinear, aniso 16, CompressedHQ, max 8192.

**Checked (2026-10-02)**
- Both files compile against Unity 6000.3.10f1's own DLLs with Unity's bundled Roslyn, with warnings treated as errors.
- Logic tests pass under the bundled .NET 6 runtime:
  - jump rate matches the hold settings;
  - per-frame blend steps never exceed the smoothstep peak;
  - the K07→K00 loop blend stays inside [7, 8) and then holds at 0;
  - crawl amplitude and duration match, and print speed stays ≤ 0.12 m/s.
- Not yet run inside Unity.

## Promotion

Do this only after the visual chat promotes P0 and Red agrees, while no other chat is compiling.

**Since 2026-10-07 the importer depends on Q1b.** The staged importer first calls `FrontRoomsPrintArray.IsPrintSheet(assetPath)`, which the visual chat's Q1b merge adds. Promote it only after Q1b has landed.
- From then on it handles only the FR_Ink* sheets.
- The wallpaper array `Resources/Print/FR_Print_HardEdge` is built by the visual chat's builder, not by this importer.
- Step 2 below is superseded by Q1b, which writes the array and `_PrintTex` itself.

1. Copy `unity_staging/Assets/Scripts/Rendering/FrontRoomsPrintDriver.cs` and `unity_staging/Assets/Editor/Print/` into `Assets/`.
2. Create `Assets/Resources/Print/`. Copy `out/FR_Print_HardEdge.print.json` first, then the `.png`, so the importer finds the sidecar on the first import.
3. In Play mode, check that the `FrontRooms Print` object appears and the walls show frame 0, then a blend about every minute.

## Glow-ink typography v2 (平面视觉, 2026-10-03)

The ink typography is owned by 平面视觉; the strings are owned by the narrative chat. The v2 spec is `ink/egress_v2_typo.json`, rendered to `ink/out_v2/`:

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 Tools/print/ink_tool.py build Tools/print/ink/egress_v2_typo.json Tools/print/ink/out_v2
```

**Type rules:**
- Heros Bold, 22 mm cap, with +1.0 mm tracking between characters.
- Cap/em is measured from the font itself (0.729).
- GPOS pair kerning comes from `otkern.py`, because this Pillow has no raqm.
- Widths match 平面视觉's measurements to within 0.2 mm.

**Layout:**
- Slots of 750/n mm, each phrase flush at its slot origin, with no separators between phrases.
- Some layers use two-line blocks.
- Rows brick-offset by half a slot.
- NO / EXIT at 32 / 16 mm.

**Stamp:** an architect's title block at (90, 536) mm, with registers at the roll edges.

**Layers 8 and 9** switch to 平面视觉's artwork when it arrives. Use `{"orient": "image", "path": ...}` with a 4096 px PNG.

## Glow-ink textures (spec v1.2, 2026-10-03; queued as Q2 in Documentation/VISUAL_CHAT_TASKS.md)

The content comes from the narrative chat's frozen EGRESS spec (`Documentation/research/wallpaper_motion/30_narrative_phosphor.md` §A.11, saved as `ink/egress_v1.json`). It is rendered by:

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 Tools/print/ink_tool.py build Tools/print/ink/egress_v1.json Tools/print/ink/out
```

The tool also writes `ink/out/ink_report.json` (fit, seams, stroke-fill and stamp checks) and `ink/out/ink_preview.png`. v1.1 (per-shape glyph frames, RG substance) is withdrawn.

The print's B channel stays reserved at 0, because B is one substance per slice for the whole world. The ink content lives in two global arrays instead, both sampled only inside the shader's glow-mask branch.

| Global | Size, format | Frame / UV | Layers | Memory |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `_FR_InkType` | 1024×1024, BC4, linear, mips, Repeat, aniso 16 | One frame for all layers: `u = dot(posWS, normalize(cross(N, up))) / 0.75`, unmirrored so text reads left to right on both sides of a wall; `v = (height − 0.8 m) / 0.75` | 0 FLOW `THIS WAY OUT`, 1 FLOW T2+ `THIS WAY ON`, 2 HERE door `EXIT`, 3 HERE window `EXIT · BREAK GLASS`, 4 STOP `NO`/`EXIT` pairs, 5 BREACH `OUT OF SERVICE · DOES NOT CLOSE`, 6 pressure chevron `ALARM · THIS WAY OUT`, 7 pressure door `FIRE DOOR · KEEP CLOSED`, 8 forged `THIƧ WAY OUT` (hand-lettered), 9 GROUND scratch cluster, 10–15 unused | ≈ 10.7 MB |
| `_FR_InkSubstance` | 768×1152, BC4, linear, mips, Repeat, aniso 16 | The print UV (warped), one 0.75 × 1.125 m roll tile | 0–4 = run tiers 1–5 (roll stamp `SHEET A-3 / A-4 / A-1114 OF 4`; `OCCUPANTS 2` from tier 5) | ≈ 2.9 MB |

**Values:**
- Layers 0–8: field 1.0, type 0.55. A stroke keeps a mean of at least 0.6 in any 100 mm square.
- Layer 9: background 0, marks 1.0, composited in the shader as `max(substance, scratch)`.
- Substance: field 0.7, marks 0.4.

**Layer 9 shader rule:** show it only when all of these hold:
- the run tier is ≥ T3 (TierChanged ≥ 4);
- it is a GROUND cell with `Hash(seed, cell & 63, 977) < 0.125`;
- it is on one hashed 0.75 m tile per face;
- v ∈ [0, 1).

**Layout:**
- Horizontal layers: rows at a 37.5 mm pitch, brick-offset.
- Vertical-bar layers (2, 3, 5, 7): baked rotated 90° clockwise, reading top to bottom.
- STOP: pairs on a 62.5 mm vertical period, so any 120 mm bar holds a whole pair.

**Layer selection:** a global `float4 _FR_InkTypeLayer[4]` lookup table, filled by the CPU.

**WebGL:** substance only, at 384×576, or the B/A two-family fallback. The visual chat chooses.
